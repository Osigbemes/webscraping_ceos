Those five words were a staple of Hill Street Blues, the classic '80s cop series that changed the way dramatic television was filmed and set the bar for small-screen characterization and episodic storytelling. The entire season is out today on DVD for the first time ever, courtesy of Shout! Factory, and two of the show's stars --Charles Haid and James B. Sikking  happily reminisce about the show and its impact for ETonline. ""We changed television -- the way it was done, the way the camera was moved, the way it was gritty,"" says Sikking, who played pretentious, uptight S.W.A.T. leader Lt. Howard Hunter. ""It was a show about not just policemen, but that the police experience was a human experience."" ""The show had universal themes,"" adds Haid, who played the contentious, loyal, often-complaining street cop Renko. ""It was a miracle at the time, just the synergy of the right people at the right time at the right place, it created and started a whole [movement] in [the television] business, so it has its place in history and I'm proud to be a part of it."" Related Video: Fave TV Moms Reunite! Created by Steven Bochco and Michael Kozoll, Hill Street Blues ran on NBC for seven seasons between 1981-1987 and featured a large ensemble cast of characters inhabiting a Chicago police station in the worst part of town. From the street gangs, junkies and prostitutes to the beat cops, undercover detectives and administrators of Hill Street Station, the show's myriad storylines deftly balanced the crime, power-struggles and politics of the setting with the very human emotions that were affected by the ebb and flow of circumstance. ""If you look at the style of that show  play it forward to NYPD Blue, play it forward to ER  it came from [director Robert] Altman, it came from Marty [Scorsese], all of those guys. ... [it was about] pace, form, making choices, breaking rules,"" recalls Haid, who went on to become a very established director himself. ""We had great love and affection for one another, we were very creative, it was often bedlam, and it was more serious than a heart attack, which was great."" Asked if he has fond memories from the set, Sikking replies with a laugh, ""A truckload. I mean, it was so much fun. It changed my life, once the audience found it. ... I think it represents a major part of my career. It changed my position in show business. I'm happy that it was as joyous and as much fun and well-received, because I know people who have a career based on something that they thought was terrible, and have tried to live down, and thats not my case; I wish every actor had the joy I had by having a Hill Street in their life."" Haid concurs, revealing that decades after the curtain closed on the series, the cast still comes together to celebrate: ""We had a cool party about a year ago, and we all showed up, and it was wonderful to see everybody,"" he says, adding that, among the entire cast, he maintains the closest relationship with his onscreen partner, Michael Warren.

Designer L'Wren Scott and rock musician Mick Jagger pose as they arrive at the 2009 Vanity Fair Oscar Party in West Hollywood, California. (Reuters) Artist Ruby Mazur, who created the Rolling Stones famous tongue logo, claims frontman Mick Jagger is a very bad guy, who left him so depressed that he considered suicide. Mazur, who has a decades-long feud with Jagger, reacted to the suicide of LWren Scott with a scathing post on his Facebook page, which he has since deleted. He described Jagger to The New York Posts Page Six as a very egotistical, self centered, Mick Mick Mick kind of person. I feel for [Lwren], Mazur says, even though hed never met her. Had I not been as strong, with great friends, I might have hung myself too. Mazur met Jagger in the 1970s in London, and created the original mouth and tongue artwork for the Tumbling Dice album. Jagger paid him $10,000 for the art at the time to use for the cover. Since then, the image has been used on Stones merchandise and become one of the most recognizable logos in pop culture. Mazur says he asked Jagger repeatedly to give him trademark rights in order to reap fair earnings for his work, but says Jagger brushed him off. The artist then grew depressed. In the late 80s, I was living in New York, going to the clubs and being introduced as the creator of the mouth and tongue for the Stones, and then go home to my dumpy apartment. I was balls-off-my-ass broke, having created the most famous logo in the world, said Mazur. Mazur admits that he tried to kill himself by filling up his apartment with gas. If it wasnt [for] my brother calling me, he recalls.  I would have been where LWren was. When I hear [Mick] say Im her soul mate, [I say], Youre full of s**t. If you were her soul mate, and she was $6 million in debt, what is that to Mick Jagger? Nothing! He did attempt to sue Jagger for trademark infringement in the 90s but unfortunately too much time had passed. Its estimated he could have earned more than $100 million from the famous logo. Jaggers rep angrily responded, This person made a business deal decades ago. How sad and contemptible that they would use this time of personal loss to gain attention.

This undated file photo provided by Mark and Kate Quigley shows Glen Doherty, who died in an attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya on Sept. 12, 2012. (AP) Boston  The family of a CIA contractor killed in Benghazi, Libya, has filed claims seeking $2 million in damages from the Central Intelligence Agency and State Department, alleging there was inadequate security at the U.S. diplomatic post and CIA compound when it came under attack by militants in 2012. The family of Glen Doherty, led by his mother, Barbara Doherty, filed a claim with the two government agencies last week seeking $1 million for wrongful death. Doherty's friend and executor of his estate, Sean Lake, filed a separate claim seeking a little over $1 million. VIDEO: '13 Hours at Benghazi: The Inside Story with Bret Baier Doherty, a former Navy SEAL, grew up in Winchester, Mass., and was 42 years old when he died. He was among four Americans killed in Benghazi, including the U.S. ambassador to Libya, when militants stormed the diplomatic post on the night of Sept. 11, 2012, and later fired on a nearby CIA compound. Separately, Doherty's family and Lake filed a lawsuit in state court in California last week over a death benefit on a policy that Doherty was required to take out as a CIA contractor who performed security work overseas in hazardous areas. The lawsuit seeking unspecified damages claims that the broker was negligent because its staff failed to tell Doherty that the policy was essentially worthless to him: It would only pay a death benefit if he had a dependent such as a wife or child, but Doherty was divorced with no children. Doherty had been living in California. Dean Boyd, a spokesman for the CIA, said the agency would have no comment. The State Department also declined to comment. Michael Mortenson, a California attorney representing the Doherty family and Lake, said that under federal law, the claims for damages are required before a lawsuit against the government can be filed. Mortenson said that if the claims are denied, they may file a lawsuit within six months. Doherty's family argues that both locations that came under attack in Libya lacked adequate security resources and personnel despite repeated requests for more. Mr. Doherty was killed by mortar rounds that hit the roof of the CIA annex. Mortenson said Mr. Doherty's family has reached out to the U.S. government over the last two years ""to try to reach a resolution,"" but no agreement has been made. In July, five Congress members sent a letter to CIA Director John Brennan urging him to do everything he can to ""provide the appropriate assistance to the Doherty family."" ""We must ensure that Mr. Doherty's service to his country is honored appropriately, and that his family's sacrifice is recognized,"" read the letter, signed by Sen. Edward Markey (D., Mass.), Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.), Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R., N.H.), Rep. Katherine Clark (D., Mass.) and Rep. Jackie Speier (D., Calif.). In a statement, Doherty's mother said the family is ""reluctantly...now proceeding to pursue those legal avenues open to us."" ""We know Glen would have done anything to support the United States and protect our freedom as Americans. Two years after the Benghazi attack, our family has not received the symbolic justice all families of such American heroes deserve,"" said Barbara Doherty, who lives in Woburn, near Boston. The Benghazi attacks stirred fierce partisan debates in Washington. Some Republicans have said the military held back assets that could have saved lives and that President Barack Obama and then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton lied to the public about the nature of the attack. Democrats, Republican-led congressional investigations and military officers have said it is untrue that U.S. forces were ordered to ""stand down"" during the attack. The hottest stories ripped from the headlines, from crime to courts, legal and scandal.

Kody Brown, center, poses with his wives, from left, Robyn, Christine, Meri and Janelle, in a promotional photo for the reality series, ""Sister Wives"" which aired in March, 2011. (Associated Press) There was no fist-pumping or wild celebrations by the polygamous family that stars in the TLC reality TV show ""Sister Wives"" when a federal judge in Utah struck down key parts of the state's polygamy laws. In an interview with The Associated Press, Kody Brown and his four wives said they felt humbled and cried when they heard in mid-December the judge ruled in their favor in a lawsuit they brought against Utah in July 2011 after they fled the state for Las Vegas under the threat of prosecution. ""The first thing I thought about was all those families that for 100 years had lived and loved in obscurity, just in secrecy,"" said Kody Brown in a phone interview from Las Vegas. ""Not being able to claim their family or openly love one another."" Kody and his wives  Meri, Janelle, Christine and Robyn  said they hope the landmark ruling stands and enables other polygamous families in Utah to live open and free without fearing prosecution. ""It's been incredible not having to live in fear anymore and being able to fully claim who we are,"" said Christine Brown, Kody's third wife. ""We wish that for every plural family out there."" The Utah attorney general's office has not yet decided if they will appeal the ruling, said spokesman Ryan Bruckman. The state's new attorney general, Sean Reyes, has been in office for less than two weeks. Jonathan Turley, the Browns' Washington, D.C.-based attorney, said he's been told Utah will appeal. He said he's eager to defend the ruling before the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. U.S. District Judge Clark Waddoups said in the decision handed down on Dec. 13 that a provision in Utah's bigamy law forbidding cohabitation with another person violated the First Amendment, which guarantees the freedom of religion. The ruling decriminalizes polygamy, but bigamy  holding marriage licenses with multiple partners  is still illegal. Utah's law was considered stricter than the laws in 49 other states because of the cohabitation clause. If the ruling stands, Utah's law would be identical to most other states that prohibit people from having multiple marriage licenses. In most polygamous families in Utah, the man is legally married to one woman but only ""spiritually married"" to the others. There are an estimated 38,000 fundamentalist Mormons who practice or believe in polygamy, most living in Utah and other Western states. Polygamy is a legacy of the early teachings of the Mormon church but has no place in modern Mormonism, church officials said in a statement. The Salt Lake City-based Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints abandoned polygamy in 1890 and it strictly prohibits the practice today for its 15 million members worldwide. Though some have correlated the Browns fight to decriminalize polygamy with efforts to legalize gay marriage, the Browns don't see the two as being the same. ""Though we support the choices of other people organizing their families however they choose, our argument has always been very different,"" Kody Brown said. ""What we've been looking for is simply to live free and to be able to live our religion without the threat of prosecution."" The family says they never intended to challenge Utah's polygamy law in court when they decided to do the show. Janelle Brown, Kody's second wife, said they wanted to dispel the negative stereotype of polygamous families. ""We were tired of Warren Jeffs being the only image people had of polygamy,"" she said. One of the most infamous polygamists, Warren Jeffs, is serving a life sentence in Texas for sexually assaulting two underage girls he considered his brides. Jeffs still rules a sect of fundamentalist Mormons on the Utah-Arizona border from jail. The Browns are now living in four new houses in a Las Vegas cul-de-sac. That's where TLC films episodes of the show, which debuted in 2010 with footage of the family at their house in northern Utah. But despite an arrangement that looks comfortable to many, Kody Brown said they miss living in the large house they called home in Utah. In fact, they miss Utah dearly. They said leaving the state they still consider home has left many scars for them and their children. They fled in January 2011 after local prosecutors opened a criminal bigamy investigation after the first episodes aired. They left jobs, a home designed especially for their large family and a culture they knew well. The hardest part about living in Las Vegas, they said, is not being able to worship with their fellow fundamentalist Mormons who practice or believe in polygamy. They hold worship services at home. ""We are doing the best we can in our exile,"" Kody said. They hope to someday return home to Utah, but said they aren't considering that move yet. That could be the topic of a future family meeting where decisions aren't easy to reach with five heads of the households and 17 children, several who are young adults and want in on the discussion. How do they manage to keep everyone happy with the decisions? ""We do a lot of praying,"" said Kody Brown, ""and a lot of negotiation.""

(A2014) Eva Marie Saint has a perfect right to act like Hollywood royalty. She won an Oscar for her film debut in ""On the Waterfront,"" holding her ground against Marlon Brando in his prime. She was Cary Grant's dangerously sexy squeeze in ""North by Northwest,"" conquered Paul Newman in ""Exodus"" and counts greats Alfred Hitchcock and Elia Kazan among her directors. But Saint is winningly candid in a Turner Classic Movies special and an interview, a contrast to her luminous screen presence and stellar career. She remains a working actress as she nears her 90th birthday this summer, on July 4. The industry has changed during her more than six decades in it, but Saint said she takes it in stride. ""You know how to stay young? Go with the flow,"" she said. She also keeps in mind advice that she heard from film great and mentor Lillian Gish, whom Saint worked with in ""The Trip to Bountiful"" on TV and onstage in the early 1950s. ""It's today and tomorrow, and don't get cranky,"" Gish would advise actresses worried about their future, Saint recalled. ""Eva Marie Saint: Live From the TCM Classic Film Festival,"" a conversation between Saint and TCM host Robert Osborne, airs 8 p.m. EDT Monday as part of a TCM tribute that includes showings of ""On the Waterfront"" (1954), ""North by Northwest"" (1959) and ""Raintree County"" (1957). Saint, who spoke to Osborne at the 2013 TCM festival in Los Angeles (to be held April 10-14 this year), is charmingly direct about her film and TV career, her colleagues and how she combined family life with her demanding profession. Director Jeffrey Hayden, her husband of more than 60 years, offered support from the audience. ""There are no small roles,"" he called out when Saint mentioned a lesser part she had played. For Saint, there were certainly no minor leading men. She appeared with ""the most enviable list of co-stars of any actress of her time,"" Osborne said, including Gregory Peck, James Garner and Warren Beatty (in Saint's personal favorite, ""All Fall Down,"" 1962). ""She's also a wonderful storyteller and has great tales to tell."" Saint proves that in the TCM special. At one point, she delightedly recounts how ""Exodus"" director Otto Preminger took over from Newman in one scene to demonstrate how better to give her a smooch. ""I mean, he's telling Paul Newman how to kiss?"" she said, laughing. Brando, she recalls, was both ""really adorable"" and a little frightening during filming of ""On the Waterfront."" ""I felt that he could see right through me,"" Saint said of ""The Godfather"" star that she considers one of the finest actors ever. ""I don't know what happened to Marlon,"" she added, referring to his late career decline. ""I think he lost  possibly, I'm not a psychiatrist  the joy of acting."" That joy is something Saint retains, although she said she envies the respect and movie roles accorded veteran British actresses including Judi Dench and Maggie Smith. ""We don't have quite that attitude in Hollywood,"" she said in a recent interview. But she has outgrown the familiar industry practice of fudging one's birthdate. ""You reach a certain age and you're so proud that you're walking and breathing and loving and working and all of that at 90,"" she said. The still-elegant Saint is on the big screen again after an absence of several years, appearing in the fantasy romance ""Winter's Tale"" with Colin Farrell and Jessica Brown Findlay (""Downton Abbey""). In 2006, Saint played Martha Kent in ""Superman Returns"" and starred in ""Because of Winn-Dixie"" in 2005. She's still charming her co-stars: Farrell gave her five dozen roses on the final day of shooting. But her focus remains on her husband and family, including son Darrell Hayden, a design instructor at a San Francisco university; daughter Laurette Hayden, a marriage and family therapist; and three grandchildren. Acting ""could be a lonely life. I met older actresses who never married, never had children. That's not for me,"" said Saint. As a young woman, she recalled thinking, ""Much as I love this business, I don't want to grow old alone."" She and Hayden take an hour-long walk daily to help stay healthy, she said. But work still beckons, including promotion for her TCM special. ""Then I'll be on to something else,"" Saint said, confidently.

(Facebook) The Pentagon said Monday it is reviewing claims that U.S. soldiers were killed in the course of the years-long search for Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, who was released over the weekend by his Taliban captors. The sense of celebration surrounding the announcement Saturday of Bergdahl's release quickly has given way to controversy -- including questions surrounding his initial disappearance from his eastern Afghanistan post five years ago and the lengths to which U.S. forces went to find him. The names and faces of six soldiers, who died allegedly during the search for Bergdahl, began to emerge within hours of the soldier's release. Asked about the claims, Pentagon spokesman Col. Steve Warren said it's ""impossible"" to confirm right now whether anybody's death was directly linked to the hunt for Bergdahl. But the Pentagon will look further into the circumstances of the deaths being associated with the search, he said. Several social media sites have circulated claims that six soldiers died while searching for the captive Bergdahl. They are: 2nd Lt. Daryn Andrews, Staff Sgt. Clayton Bowen, Staff Sgt. Kurt Curtiss, Pfc. Matthew Martinek, Staff Sgt. Michael Murphy and Pfc. Morris Walker. Fox News has confirmed that all six died in Afghanistan, though any connection to the search is unclear. The Daily Beast published a first-hand account of the search for Bergdahl as told by a former Army officer, Nathan Bradley Bethea. Bethea says he served in the same unit as Bergdahl -- the 1st Battalion, 501st Parachute Infantry Regiment -- which lost the six soldiers in the roughly five-week search after he disappeared. ""For five years, soldiers have been forced to stay silent about the disappearance and search for Bergdahl,"" wrote Bethea, who said he participated in the searches. ""Now we can tell our story."" The 28-year-old Bergdahl left his post five days after his battalion's first casualty. Until his return, he was the only U.S. prisoner of the war in Afghanistan. The Obama administration traded five Taliban prisoners at Guantanamo Bay for the captive soldier, a decision that has also generated controversy on Capitol Hill. But Bergdahl's conduct, and his writings before his capture, have also raised questions. According to a 2012 Rolling Stone article, he sent an email to his parents shortly before his capture saying: ""I am ashamed to be an american. And the title of US soldier is just the lie of fools."" There are also reports that Bergdahl's father was communicating on Twitter with a man described as a Taliban spokesman. Sue Martin, who described herself as the Bergdahl family spokesperson, did not respond directly to questions about the criticism of Bowe Bergdahl's conduct. She said despite the controversy surrounding the prisoner swap and the latest allegations, his town of Hailey, Idaho, stands united behind him. Though some accounts say Bergdahl fell behind on a patrol or wandered off drunk, the accounts by Bethea and others say Bergdahl left his outpost, OP Mest, in the Paktika Province of Afghanistan under the cover of night. They also give essentially the same account that Bergdahl left behind his rifle, helmet and body armor, taking only his compass and perhaps a knife and water. ""The place was an Afghan graveyard,"" wrote one person who identified himself in an online forum as Jeff Howard and suggested he also was part of the unit. ""Bergdahl had been acting a little strange, telling people he wanted to 'walk the earth' ... We lost good men trying to find him."" Warren acknowledged the Defense Department has conducted ""preliminary"" investigations into Bergdahl's disappearance but said the agency has never confirmed whether he is a deserter. ""We've never publicly said anything primarily because we haven't had a chance to speak to Sgt. Bergdahl himself,"" he said. Howard lists the same six soldiers and, like others, suggested even more were either indirectly wounded or injured because vital resources -- including drones and air support -- were diverted to the Bergdahl search and troops became easy targets for the Taliban because members knew about their well-known recovery missions. Bethea gave the following report of the six soldiers killed: Walker and Bowen were killed Aug. 18 by a homemade bomb while on a reconnaissance mission; Curtis was fatally shot in the face Aug. 26 while searching for Taliban members supposedly connected to Bergdahl's captors; Andrews and Martinek were fatally ambushed Sept. 4 while heading to a village close to where Bergdahl was last seen; Murphey died after stepping on a land mine Sept. 5 near a village also associated with the captors. Bergdahl, who was returned to a Navy SEAL team near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, is recovering now at the Landstuhl Medical Center in Germany. Though Warren acknowledged preliminary ""looks"" into Bergdahl perhaps deserting, prosecution may be unlikely. ""He probably went through hell,"" Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said Sunday. ""The first issue is his health."" On Monday, senior U.S. defense officials said prosecution is unlikely ""given all that he and his family have been through.""

Merv Griffin died in 2007, but he lives on in TV history thanks to having created the remarkably durable game shows Jeopardy and Wheel of Fortune. He even composed the iconic Jeopardy theme song. But for baby boomers, Griffin will always be remembered for his talk show that ran in several incarnations from 1962 to 1986. Thanks to a hilarious impersonation by SCTV's Rick Moranis, Griffin developed a reputation for being an obsequious lightweight who ooh-ed and ahh-ed at every word his guests said. In retrospect, The Merv Griffin Show provides a fascinating window into American pop culture and politics in the second half of the 20th century. Much of that has to do with Griffin's ability to step back and give his guests room to roam, evident in the new 12-disc DVD box set of Griffin programs released last week by MPI Media Group. ""Merv elevated so many conversations because unlike so many other talk show hosts, it wasn't about him,"" says David Peck of Reelin' In The Years Productions, the company that licenses Griffin's show and programmed the set. ""He wasn't looking for the laugh. He let the guest talk. To some that made him seem like he wasn't a good host and that he wasn't engaging."" After stints as a band singer and actor, Griffin was hired by NBC to host a daytime program the same time Johnny Carson replaced Jack Paar on Tonight in 1962. The network wanted Griffin around in the event Carson faltered. That didn't happen. Still, Griffin became a fixture in the conversation business for the next 24 years. From 1965 to 1969, his Westinghouse Broadcasting show was a syndicated hit, taped at the Little Theater in the heart of Times Square. He hand-picked his sidekick, British actor Arthur Treacher (known for playing butlers), who introduced him every night with the phrase ""look sharp now, here's the dear boy himself, Merrrr-vyn."" Groundbreaking comedians George Carlin and Richard Pryor built a following on the show, which moved to CBS as a network late night entry. Griffin returned to syndication in 1973, signing with Metromedia. He kept the show going into the next decade, where it became a regular stop for the then-rising stand-up comedy careers of Jerry Seinfeld and Jay Leno. While Griffin often indulged in showbiz small talk, he also courted controversy. The set includes a 1965 appearance by Dick Gregory, still making the transition from comedian to a leading political activist for the black community. Griffin allowed Gregory to explain at length the reasons behind the racial tensions that led to rioting in the Watts section of Los Angeles. ""When you close your eyes and you don't see who it is and you don't know what year it is, you'd think he was talking about police brutality today,"" Peck said. Politicians used entertainment talk shows then just as they do now  as a platform to show a looser side of themselves and reach viewers who don't watch the news. Merv schmoozed with Richard Nixon, who was on his way to launching his 1968 campaign for the presidency  the greatest political comeback in history. Artist Andy Warhol only gives one-word answers during his 1965 appearance (with Edie Sedgwick at his side). A number of complete or near-complete episodes included in the set provide a sense of how TV talk shows were a bizarre, big tent, before cable channels proliferated and fragmented the audience. On another night in 1965, Griffin went from a lengthy segment with comedian Phyllis Diller to a historic sit-down with Mitsuo Fuchida, the Japanese Navy captain who planned the attack on Pearl Harbor. Griffin was a fan of classic Hollywood, and his shows serve as a fascinating repository of stars looking back on their careers. Lucille Ball, Jack Benny, Bette Davis, William Wyler, Ingrid Bergman and John Wayne are among those represented. Fans of surreal TV moments will appreciate Orson Welles as a fill-in host, interviewing comedian Andy Kaufman. An unabashed devotee of the sitcom Taxi, Welles spent an entire segment deconstructing Kaufman's character Latka Gravas. Another Welles appearance included in the set was taped just hours before the film auteur died in 1985. Peck says that if this first DVD set does well, there are plenty of compelling Merv-moments in the Griffin estate's archive for a second volume. There's another haunting one, too. A 1966 episode filmed on the streets of London includes a young actress named Sharon Tate  three years before became a victim of Charles Manson. Even with 4,500 hours of Griffin talk shows in the vault, there are major gaps as networks and stations routinely erased and reused videotape in the 1960s and '70s. Very few hours of Griffin's CBS years exist, but Peck and his producing partner Tom Gulotta did manage to mine a few from Nixon's presidential library. President Lyndon Johnson installed a videotape machine in the White House so he could record his speeches and TV appearances. Nixon inherited the device and used it to monitor TV appearances by his political enemies, such as George McGovern-supporter Warren Beatty in 1972, and Gore Vidal, who in his 1970 appearance, calls for the president's impeachment. ""It's fascinating,"" says Gulotta. ""The only reason we have those tapes is that Nixon preserved them for himself.""

Brady Williams poses with his wives, from left to right, Paulie, Robyn, Rosemary, Nonie, and Rhonda, outside of their home in a polygamous community outside Salt Lake City. (The Associated Press) A woman featured in a reality TV show about a polygamous family is going public about sex abuse she claims she suffered as a child in hopes of changing a culture of secrecy plaguing plural families in Utah. Rosemary Williams of ""My Five Wives"" on TLC says she was molested more than two decades ago by her father, Lynn A. Thompson and published her claims in a blog. He is the leader of the one of largest organized polygamy groups in Utah, the Apostolic United Brethren, or AUB. The AUB is estimated to be the second-largest polygamist church in Utah behind Warren Jeffs' Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints on the Utah-Arizona border. Unlike Jeffs' group, which has been plagued for years by allegations of abuse and child brides, the Apostolic United Brethren in northern Utah has a clean reputation. Thompson said the allegations were not true when contacted by The Associated Press on Friday. He did not immediately respond to a phone message on Saturday. Rosemary Williams says her father fondled her when she was 12 years old. She told The Associated Press that she does not plan to file a criminal accusation or a lawsuit against her father because she doesn't think that will do any good. She says she wants to prevent him from abusing others, especially given his recent appointment as president of the AUB, which has up to 7,500 followers across the West. Williams also hopes to be an advocate for abuse victims in patriarchal societies like the one she was raised in, where families are often fearful to report crimes out of concern they may be prosecuted under polygamy laws. She doesn't believe sex abuse is widespread among the polygamous group, but she wants mothers to be able to come forward and report it and other forms of abuse when they occur. ""The reason people are afraid to say anything is because they are upholding somebody in a position of authority and they're taught to respect them,"" Williams said. ""They are afraid of the repercussions. They are afraid of Utah coming down on them and carrying their kids out of their home."" A search of criminal charges available online show no record of any criminal convictions for Thompson, and the Utah Attorney General's Office is unaware of any formal complaints submitted against Thompson, said spokeswoman Missy Larsen. Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill said he couldn't comment on the matter. David Watson, a spokesman for the AUB, didn't return multiple phone calls from The AP. Rosemary Williams is Brady Williams' third wife. He and his five wives and their combined 24 children are featured in the TLC reality show, ""My Five Wives."" They decided to do the show in part to demonstrate that polygamy can be healthy and stable. They live in a rural community outside of Salt Lake City Lake City where most people belong to the group Thompson leads. They no longer are members of the group. They slowly withdrew during the mid-2000s after re-evaluating their core beliefs. They still practice polygamy, but only because they are happy doing so, not out of the fear of hell or the promise of heaven, Brady Williams says. She said she recently confronted her father about what happened. He said he didn't remember and that he would pray to God to remember what happened. She reported the abuse recently to another high-ranking church leader, but nothing was done, she said. Rosemary Williams became choked up and was unable to talk while discussing the reaction she expects from family and friends who are still members of the polygamous group. ""She knows that it will be very strong reprisal,"" said Brady Williams, explaining why his wife couldn't speak. ""Her family will probably disown her along with many of her friends.""

Brady Williams poses with his wives, from left to right, Paulie, Robyn, Rosemary, Nonie, and Rhonda, outside of their home in a polygamous community outside Salt Lake City. (The Associated Press) The newest Utah polygamous family featured in a reality TV show says sharing their story with a wide audience has been liberating. Brady Williams and his five wives were a bit apprehensive ahead of the airing of a pilot episode in September, but they said this week an interview with The Associated Press that it felt liberating to be open about who they are and what they believe. ""It really is like coming out of the closet,"" said Brady Williams, 43. ""It's very liberating. You don't worry if somebody thinks you're a polygamous anymore because everyone knows."" His wives feel the same way, including his second, Robyn Williams, 40, who said: ""I feel more free to just be who I am and not be so afraid."" The first of nine episodes of the show, ""My Five Wives,"" airs Sunday on TLC. It chronicles the life of Brady Williams, his five wives and their 24 children who live in a small rural community outside of Salt Lake City dominated by a branch of the fundamentalist Mormon church. The family once belonged to the group, known as the Apostolic United Brethren, but withdrew during the mid-2000s after re-evaluating their core beliefs. Now, they practice polygamy not because they think they must to get to heaven, and avoid hell, but because they prefer the lifestyle. Their show begins airing in a social and political climate that has softened significantly toward plural families in recent years. A federal judge in Utah struck down key parts of the state's polygamy laws in December, marking a victory for the Williams and hundreds of other polygamous families in the state. The ruling decriminalizes polygamy, making only bigamy  holding marriage licenses with multiple partners illegal. The family that brought that lawsuit against the state of Utah, Kody Brown and his four wives from TLC's ""Sister Wives,"" is credited with helping create greater acceptance for plural families. Their show, which debuted in 2010 with footage of the family at their house in northern Utah, was ground-breaking in demonstrating to viewers across the country that not all polygamists are child predators like Warren Jeffs, the imprisoned leader of a polygamous sect on the Utah -Arizona border. The Williams family members said they don't expect viewers to be surprised by much, other than maybe how similar they are to non-polygamous families. It's normal times five, the family jokes. Viewers will see tears, joy and quarrels, they said. TLC is banking on viewers being fascinated by the unique dynamics of a plural family: regular family sit-down meetings among the adults where Brady Williams follows an agenda written on a notepad; side-by-side multi-plexes where they live; and nightly family dinners where the children line up like kids in a school cafeteria to get their food. Then there's the always-intriguing dynamic among the wives who share a husband. In the first episode, Brady Williams suggests the women work out their issues directly with one another rather than always coming to him, only to see it lead to hurt feelings and shouting. Among the topics discussed by the family during the season is a possible move out of Utah, maybe even to Washington state. The Browns of ""Sister Wives"" fled Utah for Las Vegas after their show aired under the threat of prosecution from a county official. The Williams aren't terribly worried about that happening to them, as long as the recent court ruling stands. But they say they don't feel welcomed in the tight-knit community where almost everyone but them belongs to the church. ""There haven't been any overt acts of disapproval,"" Brady Williams said. But he added: ""We want to be able to feel comfortable in our own skin."" Aaron Bronson, a principal at the school in the community and member of the Apostolic United Brethren, said he doesn't begrudge the Williams family for doing the show. He said the production crews have been respectful, and he's heard no complaints from the Williams family's neighbors. ""If they want to go public with what they believe, it's their choice,"" Bronson said. ""It's not something I would choose to do with my family. It's a rocky road.""

Its very exclusive  so far Im the only one who has accepted. Buffetts company owns Dairy Queen, and just took a stake in 21st Century Fox. We hear movie mogul Weinstein and the financial whiz work together on the Goldman Sachs initiative 10,000 Small Businesses, which aims to help small companies grow. Last year, Buffett also blew off the awards invitation with the message, Since I didnt get nominated this year, I am just going to stay home.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy Admit it, most of us can only dream we invest as brilliantly as billionaire Warren Buffett and Wall Street goliath George Soros. This spring, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathawaybought Van Tuyl Group and renamed it Berkshire Hathaway Automotive -- becoming the fifth-largest dealership group in the U.S., with over $9 billion in annual revenue.Also just recently, Soros Fund Management made good on its well-known intention to enter the automotive retail sector by investing in McLarty Automotive Group, which had recently acquired eight vehicle dealership stores in Missouri. It's not rocket science. Monthly new-vehicle sales in the U.S. are testing record highs, and transaction prices keep moving higher. Gas prices remain low, fueling sales of highly profitable SUVs and full-size trucks, and credit remains easily available for consumers to finance these big-ticket items. While we individual investors unfortunately can't simply buy up entire dealership groups like Buffett or Soros did, we can invest in companies that are also poised to benefit amid a lucrative selling period in the U.S. auto industry. Here are two intriguing options to dive into further. 1. CarMaxCarMax took advantage of consumer distrust of dealership salesmen, becoming the first auto retailer to successfully create a no-haggle pricing environment -- and it's resonated with American consumers extremely well. CarMax pays its salespeople the same flat-rate commission no matter what vehicle the consumer buys -- thus, the consumer doesn't need to worry that they're being influenced into buying a car that's not optimal for them just because it inflates margins for the dealership. It's a business model that has excelled over the last decade, with impressive growth rates. Data source: CarMax's June 22, 2015, annual shareholders' meeting presentation. CarMax is different from the other dealership group on this list primarily because it focuses on used vehicles for the bulk of its retail sales. It's absolutely a used-vehicle expert, having retailed over 5 million vehicles and appraised more than 21 million vehicles. That huge amount of sales and appraisal data means that CarMax has more pricing information than just about any entity in the industry. That in turn translates into accurately priced vehicles, enabling CarMax to successfully retail more than 99% of the company's vehicles that are on dealership lots. Data source: CarMax's June 22, 2015, annual shareholders' meeting presentation. Another reason CarMax is intriguing is that its footprint across the nation creates a network effect. CarMax's inventory of 60,000 used vehicles nationwide enables consumers to browse its nationwide inventory on its website, and then have a vehicle transferred to a local store for purchase. That makes each new store that CarMax opens more valuable to consumers all across the nation. Ultimately, CarMax is a used-vehicle-selling machine, and as the company accelerates the pace of store openings, its future growth story is one that investors hoping to cash in on a surging U.S. auto industry should consider. 2. Sonic AutomotiveSonic Automotivediffers from CarMax in that it drives more than half of its revenue from new-vehicle sales, rather than used vehicles. The company is one of the largest automotive retailers in the U.S. and at the end of 2014 operated 118 franchises that cover 25 brands in 13 states, as well as 19 collision repair centers. Sonic Automotive is geared toward the luxury market. In 2012, Sonic's luxury brands generated 52% of new-vehicle revenue, and that has grown to more than 56% by the end of 2014 -- with a heavy influence on BMW, Mercedes, Lexus, and Audi. On the flip side, Sonic's import brands (Honda, Toyota, Volkswagen, Hyundai, Nissan) generated 33.5% in 2012 and 31% of revenue at the end of 2014. Domestic brands generate even less, with Ford and General Motors brands generating 14.5% of total new-vehicle revenue in 2012 and only 12.8% last year. Sonic's focus on luxury vehicles as well as its service repair centers will help the company maintain profitability even during economic downturns. While Sonic's focus is now on luxury vehicles, though, its growth story revolves around expanding its retail business and competing with CarMax in the used-vehicle world. Sonic's One Sonic-One Experience, which has yet to be rolled out to all of its stores, promises consumers no-haggle pricing and completion of a purchase within 45 minutes with one sales rep using an iPad. Furthermore, Sonic's dive into the used-vehicle business will revolve around its new EchoPark stores. The EchoPark business model calls for a ""hub store"" in major markets that will handle vehicle reconditioning work and then distribute vehicles to smaller neighborhood stores that typically hold less than 40 vehicles, compared to a hub store that would hold about 300 vehicles. Sonic expects to eventually operate its used-vehicle stores in more than 50 markets with up to 10 stores in each -- but that will take a very long time, and it will face stiff competition in CarMax, which already has a strong head start and nationally recognized brand.

I have no desire to discuss what financial pundits, or OPEC oil ministers for that matter, believe oil prices might do tomorrow. That is a fool's errand (and not the good kind). Successful long-term investing requires focusing on what you can control and, in this case, it seems like following the age old advice of the world's greatest investor is the best way to take advantage of the current turmoil in the energy markets. For investors willing to step up to the plate and sift through the devastation within the oil sector, Mr. Buffett tells us just what to look for. While there's no such thing as a brand name in a commodity like oil, what we can do is find the low cost producer. As we shall soon see, that company is EOG Resources (NYSE: EOG). Location, location, locationThe first major cost advantage EOG Resources has is thanks to the location of its reserves. Over 60% of EOG's FY 2014 production came from the Eagle Ford Shale of Southern Texas. This area is ideally situated to deliver crude oil to some of the largest oil refineries in the U.S.,thus saving the company a bundle on transportation costs. Many of the company's shale oil competitors, such as Continental Resources (NYSE: CLR) and Whiting Petroleum (NYSE: WLL), operate in the Bakken Shale region of North Dakota, the Marcellus Shale located in the Appalachian Mountains, in addition to having a modest presence in the Eagle Ford. While many have some presence there, none can matchEOG's status as the largest operator in the Eagle Ford where it possesses some 632,000 net acres of oil leases. Source: geology.com The company received a large chunk of this acreage when it was spun off from the infamous Enron in 1999 (hence the name EOG, which stands for Enron Oil & Gas). No one knew it then, but this unloved component of the Enron empire would one day own some of the most ideally located shale-oil acreage on the planet. Southern Texas also happens to be considerably easier to operate an oil well in, especially when compared to, say, those tropical North Dakota winters. The low-cost shale producerNot only is the company blessed with a large amount of perfectly situated oil reserves, but EOG is making the most of those assets. While it could be said that EOG competes on a global basis with every E&P company, large or small, comparing the operations of EOG to competitors that don't operate in the Eagle Ford (such as Continental Resources) wouldn't paint an accurate picture of just how effective EOG's management is. Fortunately for us, there are two competitors that operate on a similar scale and have comparable geographic profiles to EOG:Devon Energy Corp. (NYSE: DVN)andChesapeake Energy Corp. (NYSE: CHK). While there are a number of important operating metrics to consider, let's first take a look at these three companies' ability to both generate free cash flow for investors while at the same time grow total production: Estimated Free Cash Flow* (in billions): *Cash flow estimates calculated by subtracting ""capital expenditures"" from ""cash from operations"". Source: S&P Capital IQ Data Total Production (MMBoe): Source: Corporate SEC Filings. Let that sink in for a second. Not only has EOG drastically outperformed the competition in production growth, but it has done so while maintaining the healthiest cash flow profile of the three. The ability to grow a business, while at the same time generate excess cash flows that can be distributed to owners or reinvested in the business is the sign of a truly great operation. Granted, an exact comparison between the three is tricky. The vast majority of EOG's total production comes from actual crude oil, whereas Chesapeake and Devon derive about half their revenues from the production of natural gas. However, this is mediated somewhat by converting all types of production (Crude oil, Natural Gas, LNG) into barrels of oil equivalent. Natural gas wells have slighty different cost structures and typically longer lives than your average shale well, but since the advent of the shale revolution both Devon and Chesapeake have not only focused more and more on oil production but they have done so in EOG's backyard. Chesapeake produced 31.3 million barrels of oil in FY 2012 while last year it produced 42.3 million barrels, all while its natural gas production stayed flat. Devon derived 48% of its revenues from actual oil production last year, up from 40% in 2012. Despite the increasing focus on shale oil production by Chesapeake and Devon, EOG's competitive position becomes all the more apparent when we take a look at a few more key operating metrics: Fiscal Year 2014: Source: S&P Capital IQ Data*Reserve Replacement Costs according to Ernst & Young U.S. Oil & Gas Reserves Study 2014**Boe: Barrels of Oil Equivalent By vertically integrating its operations through ownership of rail cars, internally producing its own fracking sand, and engaging in its own water recycling, all while focusing on extraction technology advancements, EOG has created an extremely lean and efficient operation. One that not only extracts oil more cheaply than the competition but one that is able to replace oil reserves for a lower cost per barrel as well. EOG's status as the low cost shale-oil operator is further cemented in the company's third-quarter conference call late last year where its CEO, Bill Thomas, noted that the company expects a direct after-tax rate of return of 10% in Texas' Eagle Ford Shale formation should prices crash to a yet-unreached $40 per barrel. Its returns at $80 a barrel, should oil prices recover modestly? Over 100%! Lastly, it is worth noting that recently, in aninvestor presentation dated March 17, 2015, the company stated that thanks to its industry-beating efficiency and advanced methods of extraction the company is currently experiencing higher internal rates of return at crude prices of $65 per barrel oil than it did in FY 2012 at $95 per barrel. This is particularly important if oil prices stay low for an extended period. Should such a scenario play out the ability to extract as much oil as possible from each and every single well becomes increasingly important. ValuationEOG's shares are not absurdly ""cheap"" as one might expect given the recent carnage in the oil markets. That being said, the modest pullback that its share price has experienced represents a prime opportunity to buy and hold a high quality company with a superior growth profile (even when compared to a wide array of oil-industry players) for years to come: Source: S&P Capital IQ Estimates I don't put a ton of faith in Wall Street earnings estimates, and neither should you. However, given EOG's track record as the best-of-breed operator, it's probably safe to give EOG's growth potential the benefit of the doubt. Final thoughtsNo one really knows what oil prices are going to do tomorrow or even next year. This fact is just what makes EOG Resources such an attractive investment prospect: as the most efficient operator in the shale industry it will almost certainly survive the current downturn only to emerge on the other side stronger than ever. We don't know what the future holds, but there is one thing we can do as Foolish investors: follow the Oracle of Omaha's advice and buy a high-quality business with a strong competitive advantage such as EOG Resources.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy By Basil Katz and Grant McCool NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hedge fund manager Raj Rajaratnam made millions in two minutes of frantic calls after receiving an inside tip about a huge investment in Goldman Sachs Group Inc <GS.N> at the height of the financial crisis, the Galleon founder's insider trading trial heard. Prosecutors on Wednesday played an FBI phone tap to the New York jury to support their allegation that Rajaratnam knew a day before it was announced in September 2008 that Goldman would receive a $5 billion investment from Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc <BRKa.N> <BRKb.N>. Sri Lankan-born Rajaratnam, 53, is accused of receiving tips about the investment bank from his friend Rajat Gupta, who was then on Goldman's board of directors. Gupta is also a former global managing director of the elite McKinsey & Co consultants. In the phone tap of a September 24, 2008, call between Rajaratnam and his personal Galleon trader, Ian Horowitz, he is heard describing his efforts the previous day to buy shares two minutes before the 4 p.m. stock market close. ""I got a call at , right?"" Rajaratnam said. ""Saying something good might happen to Goldman, right?"" But when he called Galleon after the phone call with Gupta, the first trader he reached was unable to complete the trade. ""I, so I told Ananth to buy some, he was f---ing around, he can't, you know. So I went to Gary and just buy me, right?"" The full name of trader Ananth was not known and the other person was Gary Rosenbach, then a Galleon manager. The government contends Rajaratnam made close to $4 million in improper gains based on leaks from Gupta, whom prosecutors describe as an unindicted co-conspirator in the biggest Wall Street insider trading case since the 1980s. Gupta has been sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In all, Rajaratnam is accused of making $45 million in illicit profits from 2003 to March 2009 on stock tips from high-placed corporate insiders. A week ago, the government called Goldman chief executive Lloyd Blankfein to the witness stand in Manhattan federal court. He testified that information at board meetings was confidential and was not be shared with outsiders. Prosecutors also showed the jury on Wednesday an internal Galleon document indicating that by June 2008 Gupta had about $16 million in an array of Galleon funds. Rajaratnam had advance knowledge from Gupta in October 2008 that the bank was on its way to its first quarterly loss as a public company, according to earlier trial evidence and reinforced by prosecutors on Wednesday. The tapes were played during the testimony of Adam Smith, a former Galleon portfolio manager who pleaded guilty to securities fraud and conspiracy in January. Smith agreed to cooperate with the government in its case against his former boss. On Tuesday, he had described pressure at the hedge fund to get ""an edge"" in trading, and said he gave inside tips from a Morgan Stanley <MS.N> banker to Rajaratnam. Under cross-examination on Wednesday, Smith acknowledged he had lied to Galleon about losing one of the firm's laptops after Rajaratnam's October 2009 arrest, and had actually thrown it away in a rural part of upstate New York, where he lives. Smith, 39, also acknowledged pressure from prosecutors and the FBI, including wiretaps last year after he left Galleon. The hedge fund managed $7 billion at its peak. It was wound down in late 2009 without losses to investors. One light note Wednesday came when Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrew Michaelson misinterpreted a ""pm"" reference in his notes, meant to indicate that Smith had been a portfolio manager. ""When you were, uh, prime minister,"" Michaelson began, prompting much laughter in the courtroom. ""Not yet,"" Smith countered. The case is USA v Raj Rajaratnam et al, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, No. 09-01184.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy Since his inglorious exit as chief executive of Lehman Brothers in 2008, Dick Fuld has preferred to keep a low public profile. But nearly from the moment the storied investment bank filed for bankruptcy, Fuld has been planning, albeit quietly, a comeback as a dealmaker. It might sound like pure hubris that the man many people blame for the downfall of what was then the fourth-largest U.S. investment bank, the triggering event for the broader financial crisis, also believes he should have a second chance on Wall Street. But the notion isnt crazy  at least to Fuld. During his long career, nearly all of which he spent at Lehman, Fuld was known as The Gorilla for his tough demeanor and endless drive to make the firm among Wall Streets top investment banks -- which it was, at least until its fall. Now, at 69 years old, Fuld is laying the groundwork for his return to the business that made him both wealthy and seen by some as a public pariah. In 2009 he rented an office in midtown Manhattan, created a boutique investment firm he named Matrix Advisors, and together with a handful of staffers, Fuld was once again pitching deals using the Rolodex of contacts he gleaned during his long career. One of his first dealsand possibly the biggest for Fuld since leaving Lehman-- involved an insurance company called In The Car. The concept was simple: When partnered with an insurance provider and an automobile manufacturer, In The Car would offer a new type of incentive plan to consumers. Instead of cash or favorable financing terms, consumers would get a year of free auto insurance with every car purchase. Some investors presented with the idea thought it was farfetched. They questioned why a car company would want to offer free insurance instead of a simple cash rebate to entice buyers. But others didnt think the idea was so outlandish, and by 2011, In The Car started to take off. Fuld and the companys CEO, Robert Wallach, an insurance executive he had known for nearly 30 years, convinced insurance giant MetLife (NYSE:MET) and car manufacturer General Motors (NYSE:GM) to take part in a pilot program in two states. GM would sell the cars through its dealers, while MetLife agreed to provide the insurance policy. Of course, no investment is guaranteed, but the way Wallach and Fuld explained In The Car to investors, it was as close to a sure thing as you can get on Wall Street, several investors told FOX Business. And the companys new partners seemed ready to agree: GM, under pressure to sell cars after receiving a government bailout to survive the recession, believed it could buy the insurance from MetLife at a wholesale price and easily earn a decent profit based on the volume of cars sold, people at the company said at the time. MetLife had no problem giving GM such a discount since it would have access to GMs large consumer base for future sales, people at MetLife said. Moreover, car buyers, hurting from the economic slowdown from the financial crisis, would have gotten a break on one of their biggest expenses, buying insurance. In The Car, meanwhile, would earn fees and commissions for every car sold. Based on Wallachs projections of sales, the company was worth $20 million  a valuation that was touted to raise millions of dollars from investors, according to people who were pitched the deal. Eventually other investors came to believe that the company was worth as much as $50 million, people close to the company said. But today In The Car is anything but a success story. Both MetLife and GM were out of the pilot program in the fall of 2011 after just two months when GM determined that other incentive programs proved more efficient in promoting car sales. New management replaced Wallach as CEO; the new chief, Sanford Rich, said based on his investigation, he believed that Wallach misused millions of dollars of investor cash both to pay his own salary and make whole original investors in the company with money he raised from a group of new investors. Wallach, for his part, denied he misused the funds, but agreed with almost everyone else involved in the company that In The Car has never lived up to its advanced billing. According to some investors, In The Car is virtually worthless, having been recently valued at just $500,000. When Money Gets Personal The travails of In The Car go beyond money. Wilmington, Del. businessman Tom Smith, a former Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) executive, told people his wife lost her $650,000 investment in the outfit as a result of mismanagement of the companys finances. People who know him said he blamed both Fuld and Wallach among others for hyping In The Cars prospects for success. On May 3, Smiths wife Lindsay Smith reported her husband missing after he failed to return cell phone calls and text messages. It had been a rough couple of weeks for Tom Smith; he grew increasingly agitated that his wifes money would never be recovered, she confirmed. He told people associated with the company that he believed a fraud had taken place and that they should refer the case to securities regulators, his wife also confirmed to FBN. Tom believed in the truth and he always said Wall Street was a dirty business. As this was happening something in him just snapped. And some investors blamed him for alerting FBN to the companys problems. Those arguments turned ugly; one of the investors threatened to sue Smith, his wife said. On May 4, police told Lindsay that they found her husband dead at a local construction site. He had hanged himself. Tom Smith was 57. Shining Light on Fuld Post-Lehman Wallach, for his part, denies that he did anything wrong in selling the concept to investors and insists that his salary, expenses and use of investor cash was approved by the companys general counsel and board. He left the company at the end of 2011, and he blames current management for In The Cars sad state of affairs. Based on a round of financing, it was worth $50 million when I was there; now its worth next to zero, Wallach told FBN. That should tell you something. Fuld and his attorney declined numerous requests for comment. His attorney also did not respond to a detailed email about this report. Fuld remains an investor in In The Car and is in regular contact with current management, according to the latest CEO of the company, Jasper Jackson. The messy details surrounding In The Car and Fulds involvement in the troubled company have not been reported until now. But they shed more light on his post-Lehman career as a dealmaker, and how one of the key figures in the financial crisis has fared now that he is no longer Wall Street royalty. It hasnt been easy. Fulds brokerage record shows that civil regulatory investigations involving his role in Lehmans demise, as well as a number of civil lawsuits filed by investors remain pending more than six years after the firms collapse. Far from the big deals that he managed as Lehmans CEO, Fuld has worked mostly on the fringes of Wall Street in recent years. For a time, he was affiliated with a company called Legend Securities, which focuses on lightly regulated micro-cap companies also known as penny stocks. He left Legend at the end of 2011, records show, though he continues to list Matrix as his principle place of employment. Of the deals he has done, the vast majority wouldnt be handled by Lehman or any other major Wall Street firm; they consist of tiny financings, such as the sale of the National Stock Exchange, and more speculative ventures like In The Car, which could complicate Fulds efforts to repair his reputation as the memory of the 2008 financial crisis fades. Indeed, friends say Fuld privately bristles at the popular post-financial crisis narrative that the decision to invest in risky real estate deals while he was CEO was the sole cause of Lehmans collapse. Instead Fuld takes pride in the fact that during his 40-year career, all of it at Lehman, he built the bank into a Wall Street powerhouse. He believes staunchly that Lehmans collapse wasnt the mistake of one man, but the result of a short-term panic that engulfed the entire financial system, friends said. Those people also say that to this day, Fuld holds particular animus for regulators like former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson who arranged the 2008 bank bailouts. Lehman, Fuld believes, would have survived the crisis if Paulson had granted Lehman the same assistance he handed to the likes of Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Morgan Stanley and Citigroup (NYSE:C). And now he may be looking to set the record straight not just through dealmaking but by discussing Lehman publicly for the first time since he was grilled by Congress investigating the firms bankruptcy in 2008. Thursday, Fuld is scheduled to speak at the Macrum MicroCap Conference in New York. According to a press release, Fuld will discuss the strategy employed by Lehman Brothers to become one of the worlds leading investment banks, aspects of the financial crisis, the current capital market environment, and the keys to success for todays growth companies choosing to access the capital markets. Luring Investors to In the Car Its difficult to say how the details surrounding In The Car will affect Fulds prospects for post-Lehman redemption. His involvement with the company can be traced to 2004, when Wallach  who developed and patented the concept of marrying car sales with a year of free insurance  said he approached Fuld for a personal investment of $1.5 million into the nascent venture. At the time, Fuld was among the highest paid executives on Wall Street, earning close to $500 million during his 15 years as Lehmans CEO. What may have seemed like an insignificant investment then loomed large after the Lehman bankruptcy in 2008 and Fuld was scrambling for work. Fuld was still considered a millionaire, but along with his reputation he also lost a massive chunk of his net worth in Lehmans bankruptcy. Enter Wallach who asked Fuld to help market In The Car through his Wall Street contacts. Wallach, Fuld and a handful of others, including Wallachs ex-wife were, at that time, the companys largest investors. But Wallach had big plans for growth. He wanted to raise new capital, and began pushing to establish In The Car as a licensed insurance agency that could operate in all 50 states. Wallach also needed lobbyists, particularly ones in California, a state that represents possibly the largest car selling market in the country. The problem for Wallach: California independent insurance agents were a powerful political force and they viewed In The Car as a competitive threat. At one point, the company hired a fixture in state politics, former San Francisco mayor and state assembly speaker Willie Brown to lobby insurance regulators to give In The Car the green light to proceed, people associated with the company said. Brown didnt return a call for comment, but Wallach confirmed briefly hiring him. Wallach, meanwhile, began pitching potential new investors; he told several of them that obtaining Californias approval was a near certainty based on conversations he had with state officials, and with California in the bag, the companys valuation would soar. While Wallach handled most of the pitches to potential new investors, Fuld had also been on at least one of the investor calls, people with direct knowledge of the matter said. Lindsay Smith, for example, told FBN that her husband recalled one conference call in 2011 where the former Lehman CEO displayed his famous hard-nosed negotiating style, giving another investor, Philadelphia-based private equity veteran Warren Pete Musser, just hours to put another chunk of money into the company. Wallach, for his part, says it was he, not Fuld, who managed to convince Musser to put in the cash. But Fulds main focus was securing MetLife and GM as partners. He knew the insurance company and its CEO Steven Kandarian well. It was Kandarian, after all, who held extensive talks with Fuld to buy Lehman in 2008. But Kandarian ultimately declined the offer after he and his team reviewed Lehmans holdings of soured real estate transactions that ultimately led to the firms bankruptcy. Fuld didnt hold any grudges as he and Wallach described to MetLife executives why In The Car would be a profitable business, a MetLife spokesman confirmed to FBN. Dream Team By most accounts, Wallach and Fuld made a good team as they negotiated with MetLife and GM, and raised millions of dollars in additional capital. The men had a long history together. They first met in the early 1980s when Fuld hired Wallach as an executive in the Lehman bond department. After just two years, Wallach left Lehman to run a Long Island, New York-based insurance company called The Robert Plan started by his father. Like Fuld, Wallachs business career had seen its share of troubles. In 2006, American International Group (AIG) sued him for allegedly siphoning money out of a joint venture. Wallach denied the charge and countersued; the case was eventually settled and terms arent publicly available. In 2008, the same year Lehman imploded, The Robert Plan filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and eventually liquidation; Wallach himself also filed for bankruptcy, records show Still, Fuld had told more than a few people associated with In The Car that he believed Wallach was brilliant in terms of coming up with ideas that can be translated into business ventures. Wallach was also a good salesman; he loved to tell stories about his business exploits and personal life as he pitched In The Car to investors. One such story involving his military turns out not to be true, these people say. Wallach, who according to his LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) profile graduated from Columbia Universitys prestigious business school with an MBA also said he served in the military during the Vietnam War, and lost one of his eyes while saving a friend during a firefight. By the first half of 2011, MetLife and GM agreed to test In The Car in Washington and Oregonand promised a bigger rollout depending on success. By mid-2011 dozens of states gave In The Car regulatory approval to offer the service. GM, for one, was so optimistic it had paid for ads touting In The Car for the upcoming Super Bowl. It was around this time that Wallach approached Musser to gauge his interest in being the companys largest investor. Before private equity was dominated by the likes of Blackstone (NYSE:BX) and KKR (NYSE:KKR), Musser was one of its biggest and most successful players. He funded dozens of companies through Safeguard Scientifics, an investment firm that he founded in 1955. During his long career, Musser helped Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) founder and former CEO Ralph Roberts build the company into the nations largest cable provider. Musser also prodded the entrepreneur Joseph Sigel to start QVC. An award at Temple Universitys business school is named after him and with good reason: By the late 1990s, Musser was estimated to have had a net worth of close to $1 billion. But he lost nearly all of it by speculating on technology stocks during the dot-com bubble, and as his net worth fell Musser became one symbol of the eras excess. The Wall Street Journal and Fortune ran long exposes about Mussers fall from one of the deans of the private equity business, to a gambler in risky Internet stocks. If Musser shared a common trait with Fuld it was perseverance in the wake of an embarrassing defeat. Musser left Safeguard in 2001, and went back to his roots by forming the Musser Group, a new private equity firm, which according to its website, helps entrepreneurs take their companies to the next level. Fast forward to 2011, Musser was now in his mid-80s, and according to business associates, an easy target for a sales pitch that In The Car was destined to be a wild success. Fulds presence certainly helped, adding the imprimatur of Wall Street respectability to the venture. And before long, The Musser Groups investment totaled around $8 million after several rounds of fundraising, Rich, the former CEO, said. Musser declined repeated requests for an interview, but people close to him including Rich confirmed that he assembled about a dozen people to take part in the deal. Those people included Ira Lubert, a multi-millionaire private equity executive based in Philadelphia, and Thomas Lynch, a retired rear admiral in the Navy and former superintendent of the US Naval Academy. Lynch appears in advertisements that air on the Fox News Channel and FBN as the head of a company called New Day USA, which says it provides home mortgages to veterans. Both men confirmed their investments in the deal and referred calls to Musser. Others associated with Musser came from more modest means. They included Smiths wife Lindsay, who had a $650,000 investment in the company. Tom Smith had a varied career in finance. He spent some time at Morgan Stanley and then, according to a Bloomberg profile, he was listed as a managing director of the Musser Group. More recently, he started his own consulting business. In an interview, Lindsay Smith said her husband warned Musser about putting additional money in In The Car because he didnt believe the hype surrounding companys value. But Musser couldnt be dissuaded, she said. In fact he was so excited about the companys prospects that he purchased a vanity license plate for his Cadillac with the words The Car scrolled across it. He included news of the investment on the Musser Groups website. GM announces free car insurance with purchase of a new car, In The Car a Musser Group partner company partners with GM and Met Life to create this unique offering, read an item that linked to a July 7, 2011 Fox News article about the pilot program taking place in Oregon and Washington and plans by GM to expand to other states depending on sales. But Mussers excitement was short lived. As the pilot program continued, GM began questioning whether the insurance incentive provided enough lift in sales to justify offering the program nationwide. In other words, the car company could sell more cars using other incentives than it could by offering a year of free insurance, people who spoke with GM said. Another big hurdle for GM: Despite Wallachs assurances, California decided not to approve the program. The pressure from the independent insurance agents apparently overwhelmed even Willie Browns lobbying abilities. With GM exiting, MetLife dropped out of the program as well. We participated in the pilot program with GM because we thought it would boost our sales of auto insurance, a spokesperson for MetLife said. The pilot was ended by GM after two months. We did not participate in marketing the program to other investors. A GM spokesman declined to comment, but would not deny the details of the companys involvement, Then the finger pointing began. Some investors began to question Wallachs judgment and truthfulness about In The Cars prospects. Tom Smith did some research on Wallach. Smith, for example, discovered Wallach never served in Vietnam despite his claim that he lost his eye saving a friend during battle, his wife confirms. In an interview with FBN, Wallach acknowledged that he told investors and Fuld he served in Vietnam and that it was untrue. In fact, he said, he lost his eye in a childhood accident. When Wallach told Fuld the Vietnam thing was false Fuld got nuts and was wildly angry, Rich, who overheard the conversation, said. Investors began to wonder what other yarns Wallach had spun. I remember one time Fuld telling me Wallach was brilliant but you cant trust a word he says, Rich said to FBN . Changing of the Guards In late 2011, Musser discovered at a meeting that In the Car had no cash on its balance sheet despite Wallachs successful efforts to raise money, Rich said. He immediately brought in Rich as the companys new CEO, while Wallach remained on as president, Rich added. Richs first assignment as CEO was to sort out what Musser believed was a financial mess. It didnt take long for Rich to figure out what went wrong, he said: after reviewing the companys financial documents, he found that Wallach paid a few expenses but he took the vast majority of the money he raised from the Musser Group, and transferred it to older investors, including Wallachs ex-wife. Rich said financial statements also showed that Wallach used the remaining cash to pay himself $1 million in salarya sum Wallach said in an interview with FBN is closer to $600,000. Rich said he confronted Wallach with what he found; Wallach, Rich said, told him he was owed the money because he had worked as CEO without a salary for more than a year. Wallach then explained to Rich that he paid off older investors with the new investors cash because he didnt want to dilute the holdings of people like Musser who would retain all the benefits when In the Car took off. I remember telling Bob thats all well and good if this is a success, but if its not, theyre going be calling you a crook, Rich said in an interview with FBN. Wallach told FBN that he left In The Car at the end of 2011, and has had little to do with its management since. His shares have been turned over to the bankruptcy court, he said. He also reiterated that the money transfers were totally legal and appropriate, and they were approved by the companys board and general counsel. Sandy Rich is a liar, Wallach told FBN. When I left the company one of the investors did a full forensic audit of (In The Cars) finances and they were perfectly in order. Wallach also said MetLife has made royalty payments to the company of as much as $1 million. Where did it go?, he asked. Rich, meanwhile, said he remains less sanguine about Wallachs tenure as CEO. He said Wallach had total control over In the Cars finances and could sign off on any expenditure. Rich said when he presented his analysis to Fuld, he was incredulous. Fuld said he had no idea about the money transfers or that Wallach had paid himself so handsomely, Rich said. Rich, now an executive at the U.S. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., then recommended to Musser that he should seek legal action to recoup his money. You cant go after Wallach; hes in bankruptcy, but you can go after the people who got the cash that Mussers people put in, Rich told FBN. No lawsuit has been filed. Through much of 2012, Rich continued negotiating with GM, MetLife and other potential partners. We met with them a bunch of times, and we never could make the numbers work to their liking, Rich said. He said he also spent a considerable amount of time with Fuld; Rich said his investigation showed that Fuld didnt take any money out of the company, as a result, his investment is worth about as much as everyone else who didnt get paid out by Wallach. At one point in 2012 Fuld proposed that Matrix be hired as a consultant to help In the Car regain its lost momentum, Rich said. I told him that makes no sense, Rich recalled. The company didnt have any money to pay me as CEO much less a consultant. Rich left In The Car in 2013 and he was replaced by an insurance lawyer, Jasper Jackson, who once worked for Wallach as attorney with the Robert Plan. Jackson said he has little contact with Wallach in his current role, though he often meets with Fuld about the companys potential, which he believes still exists. At some point a car manufacturer is going to realize that this program gives them a competitive advantage particularly when the economy slows and sales drop, Jackson said. Auto insurance is very costly. Either way, In The Car today is a far cry from the company it was back in 2011. Rich said that Musser has removed the In The Car license plate from his Cadillac. In recent weeks Musser also removed any reference to In The Car from his website. It was around that time in early May that Musser also threatened to sue Tom Smith, Smiths wife Lindsay said in an interview. Though Smith and Musser had been close for years, the relationship became strained as In The Cars valuation plummeted, and investors, including his wife, found that their money had been lost, Lindsay Smith said. Tom Smith said he believed these investors were victims of fraud, she added. When Musser was alerted that FBN was inquiring about In The Car, he alleged that Tom Smith was the leak and said he was preparing legal action against him, Lindsay Smith added. Within days of the threat Tom Smith took his own life. Rich, who remains in close contact with Musser, confirmed that his old boss was concerned that any adverse publicity would doom the companys chances for good, but he added economics kills deals not bad publicity. Lindsay Smith, meanwhile, is still searching for answers as to why her husband, a man with great potential work ethic, and a strict sense of right and wrong, would take his own life. Tom believed in the truth and he always said Wall Street was a dirty business, she told FBN. As this was happening something in him just snapped.

But when Ol' Blue Eyes needed a retreat from the world, he made his way to the California desert. About 15 minutes from Palm Desert is where the entertainer chose to build his getaway, named Villa Maggio. The eight-bedroom, 13-bathroom compound is located in the high desert (4,500 feet above sea level) where temperatures are considerably cooler than on the desert floor, explains listing agent Richard Nolan. Sinatra used the home during the 1970s with his fourth wife, Barbara, in the midst of a period where he was hinting at retirement. Back on the market for $3.95 million, it includes three buildings -- the main home, a guesthouse, and a pool house -- all with stunning views of the desert. There's also the helipad, which Sinatra used to ferry in his friends from Palm Springs, which is more than an hour's drive over circuitous roads. The gated compound, named for the role in "" From Here to Eternity"" that earned Sinatra an Oscar, has its own road off the highway and is only 20 minutes from Palm Desert. Sinatra eventually donated the home to Loyola Marymount University, which later sold it. The current homeowner is the first to actually live there since Sinatra and has maintained many of the features the entertainer had installed, including the orange backsplash in the kitchen and the orange chairs in the dining room. ""Orange was Sinatra's favorite color,"" notes Nolan, who has sat in the dining room chair Sinatra used when hosting his Rat Pack friends and others at the home. ""It just gives you a vibe -- you feel the energy from it,"" he says. ""The home is a time capsule. This is in original condition."" A letter signed by Sinatra to ""From Here to Eternity"" director Fred Zinnemann hangs in the home along with photos of Sinatra. In her book, "" Lady Blue Eyes,"" Barbara Sinatra writes about their time at the home: ""We swam and sunbathed, played games and ate and drank what we liked when we liked. It was heaven."" The crooner's legacy could make this property heaven for a Sinatra fan, or for a new owner who wishes to capitalize on its past by turning it into a vacation rental property with a heck of a pedigree.

In 1991, Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway first took a significant ownership stake in M&T Bank . At that point, M&T had been run by Robert Wilmers for about nine years. Buffett preaches the value of strong leadership in the companies he owns. He doesn't really make it a habit to buy a company and immediately retool leadership --except, perhaps, when he's partnering with the 3G Capital guys. He'd rather invest in a company that isn't broken -- a company that has a competent, competitive, and experienced management team. In other words, a company run by someone exactly like Robert Wilmers. Who is Robert Wilmers?Wilmers, a graduate of Harvard undergrad and business school, has been running the ship at M&T Bank since 1982 when he was first elected to the board of directors. At that time, M&T Bank had about $2 billion in total assets. As of the third quarter of 2014, the bank reported $97 billion. Shareholders, too, have been rewarded by Wilmers' performance. The stock has returned more than 23,500% since 1980and has endured and prospered through the two most significant economic collapses since the Great Depression. It has done so by being exactly the kind of bankstockthat has made Warren Buffett, well,Warren Buffett! Wilmers is clearly a banking star, but he's much more than that. He really is a model of the CEO we should all hope to find leading the companies we own. He's a shareholderWhat exactly does that mean? First of all, it means that he puts shareholders first because he is one. He owns more than 2.6 million shares of M&T, which is about 2% of the entire company. His $950,000 salary is literally chump change next to the wealth he generates from the bank's long-term success. When shareholders win, Wilmers wins, and that's a good thing. Even better still -- he's been a shareholder for more than 30 years. You don't have to worry about Robert Wilmers making questionable decisions just to keep analysts happy every quarter; he's thinking about the long term. Examples of his hard-earned wisdomBy taking the long view, Wilmers has learned some serious lessons -- and he isn't shy about sharing them. What does he think of the megabank business model? It's ""unsafe"" and a ""virtual casino."" What about those complex derivatives that were so central to the financial crisis?""I would put derivative trading in a subsidiary and tax it at a higher rate. If they fail, they fail,"" he told The New York Times. In his view, what should a bank be? Banks should exist ""for people to keep their liquid income, and also to finance trade and commerce."" We should note that trading for profits, betting on derivatives, and making loans to borrowers who can't repay the debt are omitted from his vision. What about building a culture at the bank? In last year's annual report, he said [emphasis added]: How many other modern bank CEOs would put themselves in the cross hairs like that in a manner as public as the company's annual report to shareholders!? The biggest reason Berkshire Hathaway owns more than 5% of this companyWhen analyzing a business, it's easy to focus intensely on the financials and forget to step back and think about the bigger picture. But in the end, the financial results on the income statement, balance sheet, and statement of cash flows are a direct result of management decisions. It's just that simple. These human beings control how the business interacts with the marketplace, how it seeks to achieve a competitive advantage, and how it allocates its capital. This is the reason why Warren Buffett focuses so much energy on evaluating the leadership involved in his investments. In a sense, he isn't so much investing his capital into a corporation; he's investing it into the people who lead the company. And there is hardly a person more worthy of that kind of confidence than M&T Bank's CEO, Robert Wilmers.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy When investing, knowing what not to do can be every bit as important as knowing what you should do. Warren Buffett knows this well, and much of his success over the years can be attributed to things he avoids doing. In the aftermath of the financial crisis, Buffett shared four of these things with Berkshire Hathaway's shareholders, and there is valuable investing wisdom to be found in each one. He doesn't invest in businesses whose futures we can't evaluateNo matter how exciting a business or industry may be, if Warren Buffett and co. can't analyze its future, they won't be investing in it. This is the main reason why Buffett stays away from tech stocks -- it's simply too difficult to evaluate the future of any single company. Sure, it's prevented him from pursuing potential home-run investments like buying Microsoft in the 80s, but it also helped Berkshire largely avoid the tech bubble. Buffett points out three industries that obviously had massive potential: automobiles in the early 20thcentury, aircraft around 1930, and televisions around 1950. Getting in on the ground floor of any of these could have been great, if you had picked one of the winning companies. The odds are simply stacked against investors in the early days of high-potential businesses. In the automobile industry, General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler survived, but thousands of other manufactures weren't so lucky. For example, the Stutz Motor Company, which is attributed with inventing the ""sports car"" and at one time produced the country's fastest production car, didn't survive the Great Depression -- and there were many other companies in the same boat. The point is that you should stick to companies with reasonably predictable futures. Long-established companies with stable financial footing and strong brands, like Coca-Cola or Procter & Gamble (two Buffett stocks), are the better way to go. He doesn't depend on the kindness of strangersBuffett will never count on Berkshire being ""too big to fail."" The company will always have more than enough cash on hand to take care of any potential capital needs that may arise. In fact, at any given moment, Berkshire has a stockpile of at least $20 billion, and generally this is much more. When the financial crisis hit, Berkshire wasn't among the companies with its hand out. Rather, it used its superior capital position to supply liquidity to companies in need, and made some pretty impressive profits in the process. Although it happened a couple years after Buffett wrote this letter, Berkshire's investment in Bank of Americais an excellent example of how beneficial this is. In exchange for buying $5 billion in Bank of America preferred stock, Buffett also received warrants to buy 700 million shares of the bank's stock for $7.14 per share. Well, not even five years later, the bank has done a great job of risk management and building a sustainable business, and the value of this investment is more than $10 billion, an annualized return of more than 15%. He won't have too much managementAs of this writing, Berkshire Hathaway has 62 subsidiary companies listed on its website with more than 360,000 employees worldwide. And, Berkshire manages this empire with a staff of just 25 employees at its home office. One of the main reasons Buffett acquires the companies he does in the first place is because they already have excellent management in place. Therefore, he figures it would be silly to mess up a good thing, and gives his managers the freedom to operate each company as they see fit a strategy which has paid off in most cases. The last thing Buffett wants is for Berkshire to evolve into a company with multiple layers of management and committees. Rather, Berkshire's companies will remain independently managed, and the extent of the central office's involvement will mainly be to allocate capital and support the managers. What can you possibly learn from this as an individual investor? Simply put, you should focus on companies with simple management structures whose long-term success and failure doesn't depend on any one person who happens to be calling the shots at the moment. Coca-Cola (a longtime Buffett stock) is a great example -- its distribution network and valuable brand portfolio makes it so the company could nearly run itself. In fact, Buffett has said that a ""ham sandwich"" could run Coca-Cola. He won't attempt to woo Wall StreetFinally, while many companies spend lots of time trying to convince analysts and the media that they're company is a strong investment, Buffett has no interest in doing this. Rather, it is a priority for Berkshire to focus on communicating directly with shareholders. Berkshire strives to keep its business as transparent and easy-to-understand as possible. Shareholders buy the stock because they believe in Berkshire's businesses and the ability of management to provide those businesses with the tools they need to succeed. The takeaway here is that it's generally a bad idea to invest in a business you don't fully understand, simply based on analyst or media recommendations. As a personal example, there are some biotech companies that are highly recommended by analysts right now, and I'm sure some of these do indeed have a bright future. However, I really don't understand that business well, so I tend to gravitate instead toward areas of the market I have a firm grasp on like, banking, energy, and real estate. Within those industries, I look for companies with shareholder-friendly managers, a strong balance sheet, and prudent risk management. The Foolish bottom lineAlthough Buffett originally said all of these things in the midst of a volatile post-crisis market, they still apply in both good times and bad. Stick to businesses with products or services will be needed for decades to come, invest in easy-to-run businesses that you understand, and make sure the companies have adequate liquidity for whatever the economy brings. If you do this, you'll be well on your way to creating a Buffett-esque stock portfolio of your own. The article 4 Things Warren Buffett Will Never Do originally appeared on Fool.com.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy Warren Buffett, former top lieutenant David Sokol, and the rest of Berkshire Hathaway Inc's board of directors were sued on Tuesday by a shareholder over a trading scandal that cost Sokol his job. Sokol had been a leading contender to succeed Buffett as Berkshire's chief executive until he resigned last month after revealing he bought shares of Lubrizol Corp (NSYE:LZ) before pitching the company to Buffett as a possible acquisition. The lawsuit, filed in Delaware's Chancery Court by Berkshire shareholder Mason Kirby, calls for disgorgement of Sokol's unlawful investment gains, and seeks to recover damage done to the company's reputation and goodwill. Sokol had chaired Berkshire's MidAmerican Energy unit and oversaw its NetJets Inc operations. Buffett's assistant, Carrie Kizer, who fields Berkshire press inquiries, was not immediately available to comment. The case is Kirby v. Sokol et al, Delaware Chancery Court, No. 6392.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy Berkshire Hathaway isn't quick to sell its stocks. In fact, CEO Warren Buffett's favorite holding period, he likes to remind shareholders, is ""forever."" Yet the company just closed its Procter & Gamble position -- over $4 billion worth -- according to its latest 13-F filing. That holding had been large enough to qualify as one of Berkshire's ""big four"" investments, and has been on its books for over a decade. P&G shareholders can relax, though. The sale wasn't spurred by the billionaire investor having lost faith in the company. Instead, it was simply a tool by which Buffett could efficiently raise cash to focus Berkshire's position on one piece of P&G's portfolio: Duracell batteries. Image source: P&G. Berkshire's P&G holding came into being in 2005, but not through direct stock purchases. That was the year that Procter & Gamble purchased razor blade titan Gillette, a company that Berkshire owned a significant stake in. Buffett received P&G shares in exchange for his massive Gillette holdings (and booked a nice $5 billion paper gain in the process) as a result of that deal. Procter & Gamble has been one of Berkshire's largest holdings ever since. That run effectively ended in late 2014 when Buffett struck another deal with P&G to buy its Duracell business in exchange for Berkshire's shares in the greater company. Structuring the transfer this way was classic Buffett: It helped his company save on taxes while establishing ownership of a stand-alone company. Buffett is a fan of equity investments, but prefers to own companies outright. ""Our main focus is to build operating earnings,"" rather than simply achieve growth in the investment portfolio, he has told investors. Though Buffett's sale wasn't connected to P&G's operating trends or valuation, it's worth considering whether investors should follow his lead and sell the stock. After all, the consumer goods giant hasn't managed significant growth in over two years. Sales are down due to a combination of weak organic growth, foreign currency headwinds, and a portfolio divestment initiative that has trimmed its down to 65 brands from 166 three years ago. Profits are on course to decline for their second straight fiscal year, and income investors just received their smallest dividend raise yet. PG Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts On the other hand, Wall Street is getting more optimistic about the business, judging from the stock's rising price. P&G's huge cost-cutting initiative is pulling profitability higher. As a result, returns to shareholders (in dividends and stock buybacks) are increasing as it posts a near-record level of cash flow generation. Meanwhile, there are a few bright spots in its portfolio such as Tide detergent and Pampers diapers that management believes illustrate the path toward healthier growth over the coming years. Image source: P&G. The brand shedding process is almost complete, too. If all goes to plan, the resulting company will be smaller, at about 85% of the prior revenue mark, but more profitable, with roughly 95% of past earnings. P&G should also be able to grow more quickly from that point forward -- assuming executives were right in selecting which brands to keep and which product lines, like Duracell, to walk away from. If you lack faith in P&G's transformation plan, then you might want to sell your shares now. Just don't exit the stock simply because Warren Buffett did. He was able to roll his P&G holdings into another consumer product bet under extremely favorable terms -- which isn't an option that's available to non-billionaire investors.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy As far as prominent Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) investors go, this is about as big of a win as you can get. Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) has now officially taken a $1.1 billion position in the Mac maker, according to fresh SEC filings. We're talking about 9.8 million shares as of the end of the first quarter, valued at just under $1.1 billion. Apple closed at approximately $109 on March 31, with shares losing 17% of their value through last Friday, so Buffett's position has already sustained some losses. As far as prominent investors that Apple has lost go, Carl Icahn just dumped his position, after investing a couple years ago and cashing in some hefty gains. David Tepper and his Appaloosa Management hedge fund also recently exited its position of 1.3 million shares. How meaningful is Buffett's vote of confidence? Buffett has long been averse to technology companies in general, as well as Apple specifically. Buffett is a big fan of stable companies with strong recurring cash flows and low valuations, but as a sector, tech is inherently very volatile as competitive landscapes shift rapidly. That's why it was so notable when Berkshire decided to invest in IBM (NYSE:IBM) half a decade ago in 2011. Make no mistake, Buffett loaded up too, scooping up nearly $11 billion worth of Big Blue in 2011, while adding occasionally in the years since. As of the end of March, Berkshire's IBM position was worth $12.3 billion. However, Buffett's IBM position has severely underperformed the market over the past five years, even if you factor in dividends. IBM data by YCharts. Buffett recently acknowledged that IBM has been a poor performer thus far, acknowledging the possibility that the position could prove to be a mistake. Over the years, Buffett has downplayed the idea of investing in Apple, in part because shifting consumer preferences could theoretically wreak havoc on Apple's business. At the same time, Apple must maintain a constant rate of innovation to stay relevant in the market, which keeps the pressure on each subsequent product cycle. Apple CEO Tim Cook. Image source: Apple. The Oracle of Omaha has acknowledged that Apple and other tech companies likely have plenty of upside potential, it's just these aspects of the business that reduce visibility over five- and 10-year horizons. However, keep in mind that Buffett isn't always the one making the investment decision. He has several top lieutenants that have the autonomy to make the call, and Buffett told The Wall Street Journal in an email that one of these lieutenants indeed pulled the iTrigger. With Apple shares trading even lower than Berkshire's cost basis, it seems possible that Buffett will only continue adding and building his position now that he's made the plunge. It's probably safe to say that Apple's rock-bottom valuation tempted Buffett or his lieutenants, and they're also probably huge fans of the massive share repurchase program, too. Buffett did advise Steve Jobs to implement a share repurchase program many years ago, after all. (Not that Jobs listened to him.) Present CEO Tim Cook is a lot more strategic than Jobs, though, when it comes to corporate finance and listening to shareholders, so you can imagine Cook and Buffett seeing eye to eye in a few areas.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy As President Obama mulls a replacement for Tim Geithner, billionaire investor Warren Buffett believes the best person to lead the Treasury Department during a financial crisis is J.P. Morgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon. While Dimon is not believed to currently be in the running for the plum Cabinet position, the well-respected Wall Street bankers name has been floated in the past. If we did run into problems in markets, I think he would actually be the best person you could have in the job, Buffett said in response to a question about Dimon from Charlie Rose during an interview that aired on PBS Monday night. World leaders would have confidence in him. The leading candidate to replace Geithner is believed to be Jack Lew, currently the White House Chief of Staff and a former director of the Office of Management and Budget. A number of others may also be under consideration for the top job at Treasury, including BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) CEO Larry Fink, Evercore (NYSE:EVR) Chairman Roger Altman and Gary Gensler, a former partner at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) who is currently the chairman of the Commodities Futures Trading Commission. Dimons reputation as a savvy but safe banker took a hit this year due to the London Whale trading debacle, which has cost J.P. Morgan $6.2 billion so far. Obviously, you know, there was a failure of control, Buffett told PBS about the trading losses. If you run an army, if you run a church, if you run a government, any large institution, people will go off the reservation sometimes. While Dimon had been seen as a friendly Wall Street exec for the administration, he has since criticized the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul that Obama has championed as well the policies of the Federal Reserve. Geithner is leading the administrations negotiations on the fiscal cliff and is expected to leave soon after reaching a potential deal. Shares of New York-based J.P. Morgan rose 0.59% to $41.11 Tuesday morning, leaving them up more than 23% so far this year.

United States' Michael Phelps leaves the pool after winning a heat of the men's 200-meter individual medley during the swimming competitions at the 2016 Summer Olympics, Wednesday, Aug. 10, 2016, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. (AP Photo/Matt Slocum) (AP Photo/Matt Slocum) American swimmer Michael Phelps, the most decorated Olympian of all time, revealed that he suffered a crisis of identity two years ago, which led him to consider ending his life, but it was Saddleback Church Pastor Rick Warren's book The Purpose Driven Life that gave him hope. ESPN reported that Phelps was ""struggling to figure out who he was outside the pool"" in 2014, which led him to heavy drinking and wondering whether his life was worth living. ""I thought the world would just be better off without me,"" Phelps admitted. ""I figured that was the best thing to do  just end my life."" The 22-time medal winner, who is also set to compete at the Summer games in Rio, said in a seperate interview with NBC's ""Today"" that his DUI arrest in 2014 led to a ""downward spiral"" that left him feeling the lowest he had ever been. It was the Olympic swimmer's second DUI arrest in 10 years, which along with his numerous splintered relationships, prompted him to seek outside help. Phelps found hope in October 2015 when he entered The Meadows, a psychological trauma and addiction treatment center in Arizona. There, Phelps turned to Warren's bestseller The Purpose Driven Life, which uplifted him so much so that he was nicknamed ""Preacher Mike"" by fellow patients, since he would often read to them from the book.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy U.S. stocks are mixed in mid-afternoon trading on Monday. TheS&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC)and theDow Jones Industrial Average(DJINDICES: ^DJI) (DJINDICES: $INDU) are are up 0.02% and down 0.03%, respectively, at p.m. ET. In fact, stocks, oil, and gold are largely all up simultaneously today -- a positive correlation between stocks and oil is par for the course these days, but not between stocks and gold. But let's get back to a fascinating stock-specific story which continues to unfold before us: the ongoing saga ofValeant Pharmaceuticals. Valeant CEO J. Michael Pearson is back on the job. Image source: Valeant Pharmaceuticals. Assiduous readers of this column will know that I have been following the plight of Valeant Pharmaceuticals with much interest. On Sunday evening, the company announced that J. Michael Pearson had returned from medical leave to his position as chief executive, effective immediately. Investors did not greet his return with the sort of warm welcome he might have liked, sending the stock down as much as 10% on Monday morning, to levels it has not seen since mid-November. Goodbye, guidance...Mr. Pearson needn't take it personally, however, as the press release announcing his return contained several other nuggets, including postponement of today's fourth-quarter earnings release and -- crucially -- the withdrawal of its prior financial guidance for 2016. As I wrote last week, ""Wall Street doesn't appear to have a lot of confidence in [Valeant's forward guidance]"" and today's news is enough to (justifiably) stoke the market's worst fears. It does not take to a crack analyst to observe that the company's now-obsolete guidance, which called for a 20% year-over-year revenue increase in 2016, including ""double-digit same-storesalesorganicgrowth--primarily driventhroughvolume"" looked fanciful. It's a safe bet that Valeant is not preparing to raise its guidance. It is worth following Valeant's situation not as a potential investment opportunity -- I think individual investors ought to steer well clear of it, except inasmuch as they are speculating with ""casino money,"" as opposed to investing retirement funds. Indeed, the value of the Valeant case study (which is still being written) is to learn how to spot the difference between a truly innovative business model (what Valeant was peddling to Wall Street) and a bog standard ""roll-up"" acquisition strategy (what Valeant was actually engaged in). A slick presentation can fool even the most sophisticated investors. ""[O]ur own credibility ... has been damaged by this saga.""Last week, the Sequoia Fund, published its 2015 Annual Report(link opens PDF) in which fund manager Ruane, Cunniff, and Goldfarb was forced to make the following admission: Incredibly, the manager allowed Valeant to become, at its peak price, more than 30% of the Fund's assets. This is the same firm that Warren Buffett recommended(link opens PDF)to his investors in 1969 when he was preparing to shutter his private investment partnership (the same firm in name, at least). (Speaking of the Oracle of Omaha, Buffett put up to 40% of his partnership's assets into American Express in the wake of the Salad Oil Scandal. Alas, Valeant is no American Express...and Ruane, Cunniff are no Warren Buffett.) Valeant's story is far from over and it is still possible that my skepticism will prove wrong (at least to some degree). Either way, it will provide an education for stock pickers. Stay tuned!

If you want to make money in the stock market, time and time again analysts and academics have found that the best way to do it is through buying and holding stocks for the long term. You'll want to invest in stocks that have sustainble competitive advantages that will be hard to disrupt, as well as reasonable stock prices that give them a good chance of generating returns. Three stocks that really stand out as great investments for a decade-long time horizon are Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-A)(NYSE: BRK-B), American Tower (NYSE: AMT), and Nucor (NYSE: NUE). Here's a quick look at why all three are worth considering as long-term holdings in your portfolio. I know that I'm not trotting out anything revelatory here, but Berkshire Hathaway has been one of the best at capital allocation, thanks to the shrewd nature of Warren Buffett and his partner in crime, Charlie Munger. As a result, Berkshire has an empire of companies underneath it that today generate about $5.2 billion in free cash flow annually, which Buffett mostly uses to fuel stock investments or outright purchases of companies. This isn't large numbers working in the company's favor, either. Over the past 12 months, Berkshire has posted net income margins of 12.5% returns on equity of 10%. This is what makes Berkshire such a compelling investment for decade-long time horizons. It is an incredibly diverse holding company, ranging from insurance, railroads, electric utilities, industrial manufacturing, and consumer goods. This immense diversity means that the cyclical nature of one part of the business doesn't have as large of an impact on the company as a whole. Typically, that amount of stability comes at the sacrifice of performance. As those numbers above suggest, though, you don't have to make that trade-off. At a price to book value of 1.38 times -- the metric Buffett himself uses when evaluating Berkshire's stock -- it would seem that today's share price is a pretty reasonable time to buy into Berkshire and hang on for a decade or two. For a long time, there were two certainties in this world: death and taxes. Nowadays, we can add a third thing to that list: the need for data. Every day, our mobile devices chew through more and more data, and that is a trend that is only expected to rise, as faster options like 5G start to take hold. In 2015, average monthly data usage was 2.4 gigabytes. By 2020, that number is expected to grow to 14 GB per month. The knee-jerk reaction for many investors would be to invest in the companies developing the technology that will make that much data usage possible. If there is one constant with technology, though, it's that it can rapidly become commoditized, and a company's pricing power evaporates. That is why American Tower is a great investment to ride this trend. You aren't investing in the technology that will drive this change; you're investing in the infrastructure that will make it happen. American Tower is in the business of owning and operating cellular towers and leasing space for wireless equipment on them to telecom companies. This model gives the company a stable revenue source, as telecom companies sign lease contracts that can be 20 years or more. As customers demand more and more data, the property value on these towers will continue to increase, since telecom companies need more installed equipment to handle the required bandwidth. It should also be noted that American Tower is structured as a Real Estate Investment Trust, so it throws off cash to fuel a rapidly growing dividend. It's hard to see a situation where we will use less data over the coming years, so that means we will need a very robust telecom infrastructure that will likely be installed on American Tower's base of communications towers. This is a trend that could fuel huge gains for investors over the coming decade. Buying into cyclical industries like steel isn't a great idea all of the time. Like so many other commodities that are essential to development, it is an industry that is consistently going back and forth between times of incredible oversupply or undersupply. For years, China has been the primary engine for steel demand, so when demand there stagnated, it resulted in the low price environment we have been experiencing in recent years. It may seem a little counterintuitive, but this is a great time to invest in the industry, and Nucor is one of the best stocks to invest in steel. The domestic steel industry has received a little bit of a boost lately from the Commerce Department's imposing anti-dumping tariffs on imported steel from several countries, most importantly China. While this is something that will improve margins, the real gains will come as the steel manufacturing overcapacity gets worked out of the global system. Eventually, unprofitable facilities will be shut down, and rising demand will lead to higher prices for Nucor and its peers. What makes Nucor a more compelling investment, though, is that the company has remained a solidly profitable company throughout this downturn, thanks to its unique employee incentive structures and its lower debt burden. Both of these things deliver better bottom-line results, and they're also part of the reason that Nucor has been able to maintain a 42-year streak of dividend raises. With shares trading at 3.1 times tangible book value and a dividend yield of 3.15%, I'll admit that this isn't the absolute lowest valuation for Nucor's stock. It is, however, a pretty good valuation to buy shares -- especially if you plan to hold those shares for 10 years or more.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) executive Charlie Munger still isnt pleased with Valeant Pharmaceuticals (NYSE:VRX), despite billionaire investor Bill Ackmans urging to change his mind on the company. At the annual Berkshire Hathaway shareholders meeting in Omaha, Munger, who called the drug company a sewer, said he is sticking to his comments. Theres been a complaint about my saying that Valeant is a sewer, but I thought the complaint would come from the sewers, Munger told the FOX Business Networks Liz Claman. It never occurred to me that anybody would be defending Valeant. Munger then took it a step further saying he believes sewer is too light of a word for Valeants behavior. The main thing that Valeant did that was unbelievably clever was to pay the consumers part of the deductible for the drugs they were selling, he said. That is totally illegalcriminal under the Medicare laws. But, that doesnt apply under the state laws. And they saw that loophole and so they did it with all the drugs that werent covered by Medicare... they paid the consumer share of the deductible and they tried to pretend that it was a charitable contribution, when really it was the functional equivalent of bribing the other fellows purchasing agent. Despite the criticism of the company, Munger had kinder words for Valeant investor Bill Ackman. He certainly made a brilliant investment in General Growth Properties and hes totally right about Herbalife. Hes very articulate and intelligent and hes a fellow Harvard man, so hes not all bad, he said. Ackman has publically accused Herbalife of being a pyramid scheme in a battle that has been widely chronicled on Wall Street.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy In the largest food acquisition on record, Warren Buffetts Berkshire Hathaway and 3G Capital surprised Wall Street on Thursday by shelling out $28 billion to acquire iconic ketchup maker H.J. Heinz (NYSE:HNZ). The transaction comes amid a flurry of headline-grabbing deals of late, including the $24.4 billion leveraged buyout of struggling PC maker Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) last week and a merger between bankrupt American Airlines parent AMR Corp. and U.S. Airways (NYSE:LCC) unveiled earlier on Thursday. The Heinz deal would bring the food company private and is valued at $72.50 a share in cash, representing a 20% premium to its close of $60.48 on Wednesday and a 19% premium to its all-time high. Heinz has strong, sustainable growth potential based on high quality standards, continuous innovation, excellent management and great tasting products, Buffett said in a statement. Their global success is a testament to the power of investing behind strong brand equities and the strength of their management team and processes. The deal will be financed through a combination of cash provided by Berkshire and affiliates of 3G Capital, rollover of existing debt and new financing from J.P. Morgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC). Specific terms of the financing were not released. Following the go-private deal, Heinz said it plans to remain headquartered in Pittsburgh. The parties said they expect the deal to close in the third quarter of 2013, subject to shareholder and regulatory approval. Heinz is being acquired from a position of strength, Heinz CEO William Johnson said. As a private enterprise, Heinz will have an opportunity to drive further growth and advance our commitment to providing consumers across the globe with great tasting, nutritious and wholesome products. Shares of Heinz soared in premarket trading, eclipsing the $72.50 offer price. In recent action, Heinz was up 20.11% to $72.64, tacking onto its one-year rally of nearly 17%. We fully recognize Heinzs value and heritage and look forward to working together with Heinzs employees, suppliers and customers as we invest in and support the companys ongoing global growth efforts, said Alex Behring, managing partner at 3G Capital. The $28 billion acquisition of Heinz marks the largest deal in the food space in history, eclipsing the legendary $25 billion of food and tobacco company RJR Nabisco and Krafts (NASDAQ:KRFT) $19 billion buyout of chocolate maker Cadbury in 2010.

Annette Bening, best actress nominee for her role in ""The Kids Are All Right"", and husband Warren Beatty arrive at the 83rd Academy Awards in Hollywood, California, February 27, 2011. (Reuters) When Warren Beatty met Annette Bening there was ""no doubt"" in his mind ""it was time to get married."" Once considered one of Hollywood's most legendary bachelors, Beatty opened up on why his 25-year marriage is the best thing that's ever happened to him. ""The most important thing thats ever happened  the best thing thats ever happened to me  was Annette and having four kids,"" Beatty said Wednesday on the ""Today"" show. Warren Beatty denies sleeping with 12,755 women Beatty, 79, shocked his fans when he finally tied the knot in 1992. ""It didn't really surprise me,"" he said of settling down. ""I always felt I wasn't trying to avoid marriage, I was trying to avoid divorce."" He added, ""I had no doubt when I met Annette that it was time to get married."" Nearly 25-years later, the couple have four children: Stephen, 24, Benjamin, 22, Isabel, 19 and Ella, 16. The veteran actor boasted about his brood but admitted his career choice has made it difficult for them growing up. ""It is a burden, I think, to have two parents that are well-known, so I completely respect their privacy"" he said. ""I could go on and on and on and on talking about them, because theyre brilliant and fun. But no, I think you have to give them a break, and they have their privacy.""

FAQ - New Privacy Policy A fund of funds is exactly as it sounds -- it is a fund that invests in other mutual funds or hedge funds. The basic idea is that a fund of funds can offer greater diversification and access to high-minimum funds, albeit with an additional layer of fees. One of the most common examples of a fund of funds is a target date mutual fund. Target date funds allocate investors' capital based on their expected retirement date. For example, Vanguard's target date mutual funds pool investors' money and invest it into four other Vanguard funds. Fund of funds are also common in hedge funds, which typically have high minimum investments that often top $1 million or more. By investing in a fund of hedge funds, an investor who might not ordinarily be able to scrounge up enough to meet the minimum investment for a hedge fund can invest in a fund of hedge funds and get access to an investment vehicle that might have traditionally been out of reach. Fund of funds were famously brought into the spotlight by a $1 million bet between legendary investor Warren Buffett and hedge fund manager Protege Partners. Warren Buffett bet that an S&P 500Index fund would beat the performance of five funds of funds picked by Protege over a 10-year period, after fees. So far, it looks like Buffett's charity will win the friendly wager. One of the biggest criticisms of funds of funds is that they make investing more expensive by adding another layer of annual management and performance fees. A fund of funds might charge investors annual management fees of 0.5% to 1% each year to invest its clients' capital in funds that charge another 1% annual management fee. Over time, the additional fee burden makes it difficult for funds of funds to generate good returns for their investors. Similarly, just as it is difficult to pick market-beating stocks, studies show it is just as tough to select market-beating fund managers. Selecting star fund managers from a pool of thousands of fund managers is no easy task, as historical performance is no guarantee of future results. Finally, because a fund of funds may invest in hundreds of funds, it may become so diversified that beating the market is impossible. A fund of 20 funds that each holds 50 stocks could own 1,000 investments, assuming no overlap in the underlying funds' positions. With that kind of diversification, the fund of funds' investors would likely be better off owning a low-fee index fund that offers vast diversification at a substantially reduced price. Despite the industry's criticisms, funds of funds and fund allocation are big businesses. One of the most successful allocators, Blackstone'sHedge Fund Solutions unit, recently reported having more than $68 billion of client assets that it invests in other managers' funds.

Warren Buffett - 2016,"Sep 12, 2016",https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/5-blue-chip-stocks-you-can-buy-today,"Quotes displayed in real-time or delayed by at least 15 minutes. Market data provided by Factset. Powered and implemented by FactSet Digital Solutions. Legal Statement. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. 2025 FOX News Network, LLC. All rights reserved. FAQ - New Privacy Policy Image source: Getty Images. What is a blue chip stock? If you had to stop to think, you probably aren't alone. Though the name surfaces frequently in our discussion of investing, no hard-and-fast rule exists. Generally speaking, a blue chip stock refers to a mature, financially secure, and sizable corporation. More often than not, they also often have extended track records of paying dividends. A rough proxy for blue chip stocks would be the companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, companies such as Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG), 3M (NYSE: MMM), Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), and Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE: CL), among many other potential names. Here's a quick snapshot of the numbers that qualify them for blue chip status. Data sources: Google Finance, Dividend.com. Again, it bears noting that these names merely illustrate the kinds of companies that fit the bill, but this isn't the only way to define a blue chip stock. As just one example, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway wouldn't appear in that list because of its historical practice of not offering a dividend. However, most investors would agree that Berkshire Hathaway qualifies as a blue chip stock. The key takeaway here is that a ""blue chip stock"" often refers to a high-quality company, subjective though that may seem. Regardless of the exact definition, the evidence suggests that investing in blue chip stocks tends to bode well for investors willing to hold them over the long term. Here's how the five blue chip stocks mentioned -- Procter & Gamble, 3M, Coca-Cola, Colgate-Palmolive, and Johnson & Johnson -- have performed versus the S&P 500, going as far back as our charting tool will allow. KO data by YCharts Admittedly, the above sample size of fivenames serves as anecdotal evidence. At the same time, though, investing in blue chips touches on several schools of investing that tend to outperform the market over the long term. One of the defining characteristics of blue chip stocks is their quality, expressed here in one way by their dividend growth prowess. We know dividend growth investing tends to handily outperform the market averages over time, especially when dividends are reinvested to buy more shares. Seen this way, buying blue chip stocks can be seen as an indirect way to follow a strategy we know works quite well. The idea underpinning this strategy's outperformance is simple but not obvious. According to the World Economic Forum, the average lifespan of a Fortune 500 companies is between 40 and 50 years. What's more, the average lifespan of a company appears to be falling. So blue chip companies that are able to remain in operation, such as those in our example, are by definition above average. What's more, having been able to both pay dividends over so long a period and consistently increase them speaks to the remarkable quality of these companies. Of course, no company remains impervious to change, so you can't think that simply buying select blue chip companies is a one-way ticket to easy street. Sears, Roebuck probably seemed like a no-brainer investment at one point. As with any investment strategy, diversification is crucial to owning blue chip stocks. However, the strategy appears to lie on sound investing principles. As Warren Buffett has famously said, ""It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price,"" and that's precisely what investing in a diversified basket of blue chip stocks may allow investors everywhere to do.

MasterCard (NYSE: MA) announced its first and only stock split on Dec. 10, 2013, splitting shares 10-for-1 on Jan. 21, 2014. Visa followed MasterCard's move a year later, announcing a 4-for-1 stock split in January 2015, which was completed on March 18, 2015. Data source: Company SEC filings. MasterCard's stock split somewhat obscured a substantial dividend increase in 2014. The company declared a $0.11 per share dividend, which, adjusted for the 10-to-1 split, represented an 83% increase over the company's $0.60 per share dividend paid before the stock split. Stock splits are truly superficial corporate events. When a company splits its shares, the number of shares each shareholder owns increases, and the value of each share falls proportionately. Thus, by splitting its stock, MasterCard shareholders owned 10 times more stock after the split, each valued at one-tenth of the pre-split value per share. One can conceptualize the effects of a stock split by thinking about a pizza. Whether cut into 4 slices or 8 slices, the size of the whole pizza does not change. The only thing that does change is the size of each slice. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathawayis infamous for having never split its class A shares. As a result, the company's Class A shares trade for more than $222,000 each at the time of writing. Class B shares, which have been split multiple times, trade for a much more affordable price of $148. There is no real difference between what the two stocks offer, except that Class B shares have 1/1500thof the ownership as a Class A share. Theoretically, a lower share price allows more investors to buy a company's stock. If MasterCard had never split its shares, a single share would trade for about $970 today compared to the current price of roughly $97 per share. It is generally better to buy and sell stocks in lots of 100 shares, as these so-called ""round lots"" of stock are given preference to ""odd lots"" of 99 shares or fewer by brokers and stock exchanges. By splitting its shares 10-for-1, a round lot of 100 shares of MasterCard stock is worth just $9,700 today vs. the $97,000 price if its shares had not been split. Though the difference might be negligible for billion-dollar funds and institutions, it's very important for individual investors. MasterCard went public at a price of $39, and rose to $46 in its first day of trading. Adjusted for the stock split, its IPO price was $3.90 per share, and its stock closed at a split-adjusted price of $4.60 on the first day of trading. Incredibly, its per-share dividends of $0.19 in 2016 amount to a total annual payout of $0.76, or nearly 20% of the split-adjusted IPO price! Possibly. Recall that on the day of the stock-split announcement, MasterCard shares traded for $783 each. Currently, shares trade for about $95. One would surmise that MasterCard has a long way to go before the company feels obligated to split its shares once again. To reach the price of the last stock split, MasterCard's value would have to increase 724%, which would value the company at more than $856 billion compared to its current market capitalization of approximately $105 billion.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett are the single-greatest source of incredible investing anecdotes. From a small California-based chocolate company to an Illinois bank, and a small farm located somewhere in between, it seems that all these two have touched turned to gold. At a recent Daily Journal meeting of shareholders, Munger let out a small tidbit about one of the best investments he's ever made. It was 1962, and Munger was on the golf course with a new friend, Al Marshall. Al Marshall had experience working for several oil producers, large and small. As oil was going through yet another bust at the time, Marshall was unemployed, but he was making investments on his own, buying up oil royalties at auction. Munger was then working as a real estate lawyer at a firm he founded -- he hadn't yet found Wall Street. By hole No. 2, Munger was already asking Marshall about the oil royalties he intended to buy. By hole No. 3, Munger, confident to a fault and never one to mince words, told Marshall that he was structuring the deals all wrong. Marshall said that if Munger worked out the financing and the tax structure, he'd do the rest. That's exactly what they did. As Munger described at the Daily Journal meeting this year, he and Marshall put up $1,000 each to buy oil royalties at auction. He described the auctions as a place for unsavory folks to do deals at prices that were much too cheap. ""I soon realized that under the peculiar rules of an idiot civilization, the only people who were going to bid for these oil royalties were oil royalty brokers who were scroungy, dishonorable, cheap bunch of bastards. I realized that none of them would ever bid a fair price,"" he said at the meeting in February 2016. His hunch was right. The royalties were very much underpriced, leading to some of the most incredible returns any investment could ever deliver. He added that, for ""many, many, years, the Mungers were getting $100,000 a year, 50 years later. More than 50 years later."" The only problem he could find in the story is that ""it only happened once,"" he told the crowd, laughing as he said it. In the book Damn Right: Behind the Scenes with Berkshire Hathaway Billionaire Charlie Munger, published in 2000, Munger admitted that his family was still receiving $2,000-$3,000 checks each month from his investment in the trust, all from his original $1,000 investment. This is quite clearly one of the rare investments that knocks on your door. You won't find these advertised in a late night infomercial. Munger pointed out that there is an important lesson to be learned in that life only gives you a few great opportunities in an average lifetime. ""The trick in life is when you get the one, or two, or three that your fair allotment for a life is, that you've got to do something about it."" It seems unlikely that very many people will get the opportunity to put up $1,000 and collect 100 times more each year for a period spanning more than 50 years. That's certainly an outlier. But it got me thinking about the small fortunes that far too many people pass up far too often, like a 50% match on a 401(k) plan at work, or an opportunity to parlay a small investment into a certificate to learn a new skill. Life is full of small decisions where the result is a big reward, but only if we're willing to keep our eyes and ears open to them.

Once you accumulate some money to invest, a key decision you'll have to make is whether to manage your own money or have someone else do it. There's no one-size-fits-all answer to that question since each of us has different abilities and circumstances. For many people, managing their own money is the best option. Here are three advantages of managing your own money. Brian Feroldi:We at The Motley Fool are big believers that buying great companies and holding them for the ultra long term is the best way to build wealth. That's a big reason why we regularly recommend ignoring short-term price movements and instead staying focused on the long-term potential of the companies you own. Unfortunately, one disadvantage financial advisors often face is that they can't always have a long-term outlook when they invest. Why? Well, some feel that in order to justify their fees, they need to frequently tweak portfolios. After all, if their clients saw that they kept holding onto the same companies year after year without making any changes, then the clients might start to wonder why they couldn't manage their money on their own for a fraction of the cost. Another pitfall financial advisors face is that they don't want to be caught holding the ""wrong"" stocks when it comes time to send their clients a statement. After all, if a financial advisor had heavy exposure to a poorly performing sector of the market, his clients might think he was bad at their job. To compensate, some might sell their under-performers and buy into hot stocks just prior to the statements being sent out. This practice -- called ""window dressing"" -- can protect them from being asked tough questions by their clients. Thankfully, when you manage your own money, you're under no such pressure to constantly have to justify your actions. That affords you the luxury of having a long-term outlook. That's apowerful advantageindividual investors shouldn't overlook. It's not always best to hand over your money to someone else. Image source: Getty Images. Jeremy Bowman:Employing someone else to do something for you inevitably creates friction. After all, we've all muttered, ""I should've done it myself"" at one time or another. Orders can be misunderstood or miscommunicated, opinions may differ, and personal incentives don't always align. The same is true with investing. You understand your own financial needs and goals better than anyone else. If you have the time and the interest, there's no reason you shouldn't be managing your own money. A good baseline to start with is a low-fee index fund such as theVanguard S&P 500 ETF if you're just looking to park your money in the broad stock market and watch it grow. Investors with a higher risk tolerance may seek out growth stocks or a mix of investments to offer income and growth. As your needs and expectations change, you can make adjustments to your portfolio in a much more seamless way than if you were dealing an advisor. Similarly, if you get a tip or see a stock you like at a good price, you can jump on it immediately without having to go through a third party. The plunge and recovery following the Brexit vote was a perfect example of this. The broad market fell 5% in two days, with many stocks falling much more sharply. If you wanted to get in on those bargain prices, the window was short -- the market recovered in just three days. Having control of your investments offers transparency, too, as there's no need to parse someone else's decisions. Best of all, you'll learn as you go. Managing your money is a lifelong pursuit, and though it may seem intimidating at first, you'll learn from mistakes you make along the way and adapt as you go, feeling more comfortable all the time. A lot of money can go down the drain in fees. Image source: Getty Images. Selena Maranjian: A key advantage of managing your own money is that you can avoid paying a lot in fees. Of course, if you haven't taken the time to learn a lot about investing and don't have a good plan, your savings may be outweighed by your underperformance. But for those who know what they're doing, it can make a lot of sense to manage your own money. Consider that many investment advisors or money managers will charge you a percent of your assets each year for their services. According to the folks at AdvisoryHQ, here are some averagerates: Portfolio Size Average Fee Annual Fee Cost $50,000 1.18% $590 $250,000 1.07% $2,675 $500,000 1.05% $5,250 $1,000,000 1.02% $10,200 That's serious money, charged each year, very likely costing you tens of thousands of dollars over the course of your investment period. Managed mutual funds charge fees, too. Plunk $100,000 into funds with 3% front-end loads, and you'll fork over $3,000 immediately. If they have typical expense ratios (annual fees) of 1%, you'll be paying $1,000 per year. If, like some funds, they charge closer to 2% annually, you'll be bleeding nearly $2,000 per year. You don't have to be an investing genius to manage your own money. Since most managed mutual funds fail to outperform simple index funds, and many money managers and advisors aren't going to deliver results that beat them, either, it can make good sense to just park your hard-earned dollars in inexpensive index funds, such as the SPDR S&P 500 ETF . If you want to do your own stock-picking, favor a low-commission brokerage to save on trading fees. Managing your own money isn't right for everyone, but it might make good sense for you.

Warren Buffett - 2017,"Apr 17, 2017",https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/why-warren-buffett-loves-dividends-but-doesnt-pay-any,"Quotes displayed in real-time or delayed by at least 15 minutes.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy Warren Buffett loves getting dividends from the stocks he invests in, and has invested a considerable amount of Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) capital in dividend-paying stocks, particularly in those that consistently increase their payments every year. In fact, the stocks in Berkshire's portfolio will pay the company more than $880 million in dividends during the second quarter of 2017 alone. Despite Buffett's love of dividends, Berkshire Hathaway has never paid one to its shareholders, nor does Buffett plan to start implementing a dividend anytime soon. This may seem like a big contradiction -- as Buffett himself said in his 2012 letter to Berkshire shareholders, ""It puzzles them (some of Berkshire's shareholders) that we relish the dividends we receive from most of the stocks Berkshire owns, but pay out nothing ourselves."" However, Buffett's reasoning makes perfect sense. Image source: The Motley Fool. To understand why Buffett loves dividends so much, it helps to know why Berkshire itself doesn't pay a dividend to its shareholders. In the same letter to shareholders I referred to a moment ago, Buffett laid out his priorities when it comes to the cash generated by Berkshire's business activities. The billionaire's first priority will always be to deploy cash as needed in Berkshire's existing businesses. This includes things like bolt-on acquisitions and investments in business assets. However, there is typically a lot of cash left over after its current operations are taken care of. Buffett's second priority is to search for new acquisitions, unrelated to its current business. A good example is the acquisition of Precision Castparts in 2016. Buffett and his team look for acquisitions that are ""likely to leave our shareholders wealthier on a per-share basis than they were prior to the acquisition."" Buffett adamantly defends his acquisition record, saying that shareholders are far wealthier today than if some of Berkshire's acquisition capital had been spent on dividends instead. Looking at Berkshire's book value gains over the years, it's tough to argue with this. Third, Buffett looks to use Berkshire's cash to repurchase its own shares, but if and only if they are trading at a ""meaningful discount to conservatively calculated intrinsic value."" The company currently defines its buyback threshold as 120% of book value, and the stock trades for 145% of book value as I write this. Essentially, these are the three ways Buffett is currently willing to use Berkshire's capital. If none of the three options look appealing, Buffett is perfectly content with adding to Berkshire's stockpile of cash and waiting until one of the options becomes attractive. In fact, Berkshire has a stockpile of about $86 billion as of the end of 2016, so it's fair to say that Buffett and his team are willing to wait for the right opportunities to come along. In a nutshell, Buffett loves dividend-paying stocks for the same reason he loves most of the businesses Berkshire owns. They generate cash, which can be put to use in whatever way Berkshire needs at the time. Here's a list of some of Berkshire highest-dividend stocks currently in its portfolio. For example, if one of Berkshire's subsidiary businesses needs to upgrade its equipment, the latest dividend check received from Coca-Cola can help finance it. Or, if Berkshire's stock is trading at a price level management perceives as ""cheap"", the company can use its dividend income to repurchase shares. Another possibility is to add dividend income to the company's stockpile of cash to help finance its next big acquisition. Buffett loves dividend stocks, especially those that pay dividends consistently and make an effort to raise the payout year-after-year, because they provide a consistent source of cash flow that Berkshire can deploy in whatever way it sees fit. 10 stocks we like better than Berkshire HathawayWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy Warren Buffett transformed Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) from a dying mill company to the massive conglomerate that it is today. Over more than half a century, Berkshire has achieved distinction as one of the most successful long-term stock investments in the market, and along the way, it has celebrated several key milestones. The following events have gone a long way toward defining the history of Berkshire Hathaway's stock, and investors hope that its past performance will make shares a good value going forward as well. Buffett's stake in Berkshire Hathaway dates back to the 1960s, when his partnership identified the company as a cheap stock in the declining textile industry. Buffett identified that when Berkshire closed a mill, it would buy back stock, giving him an opportunity to turn a profit. Yet by 1964, Buffett owned a considerable amount of stock. At one point, Berkshire offered to buy back his stake, and they agreed orally to a price of $11.50 per share. Yet when the actual offer came, it was for $11.375 per share. That angered Buffett and inspired him to buy a controlling interest in Berkshire, and that laid the foundation for the company that eventually grew far beyond its textile industry roots. BRK.A data by YCharts. One key attribute of Berkshire Hathaway's renown is its huge share price. The company has eschewed stock splits in its Class A shares, allowing them to appreciate as far as the market was willing to carry them. That took the stock to the $1,000 mark by 1983, which at the time was even rarer than it is today. It took just six years for Berkshire to climb from $100 to $1,000 per share, and another nine years brought the company's share price to the $10,000 mark by 1992. That strong performance outpaced the overall market, but it was supported by fundamentals. Each year, Berkshire has posted the gains in its per-share book value, and the trajectory bears a strong resemblance to its stock performance. Without actual business growth, Berkshire wouldn't have seen its share price reach unprecedented heights. Hathaway Mills Building, New Bedford, Mass. Image source: Wikimedia Commons. In 1996, Berkshire Hathaway created its Class B shares, giving the right to existing Class A shareholders to convert each share of Class A stock into 30 shares of Class B stock at will. The net impact was to give small investors a way to invest in Berkshire, which at the time commanded more than $30,000 per Class A share. Buffett didn't want to make the move, but he did so in response to financial entrepreneurs who sought to create an alternative investment vehicle to make Berkshire accessible to those with modest amounts of capital. Rather than allowing outsiders to reap fees, Buffett instead made the move himself, potentially saving ordinary investors thousands of dollars in added costs over the years and creating a way for them to participate in Berkshire's amazing run. Similarly, Buffett was never a fan of stock splits, but exigent circumstances did make one prudent. In 2010, Berkshire did a 50-for-1 split of its Class B stock. That made the shares more accessible to shareholders in railroad giant Burlington Northern when Berkshire bought out the company. The move allowed more Burlington shareholders to retain interests in Berkshire stock rather than having to liquidate what would have been fractional shares. Now, Class A shares are convertible to 1,500 Class B shares, and the current Class B price around $165 per share is squarely within the range of where typical stocks in the market trade. In the past quarter-century, Berkshire's share price growth has slowed, but it has hardly come to a standstill. Just 14 years after reaching $10,000 per share for the first time, Berkshire hit the $100,000 mark in October 2006. Just a decade later, Berkshire stock fetched $250,000 per share, and that's close to its current level today. Berkshire Hathaway looks little like it did half a century ago, and the way it has transformed itself is a testament to the investing prowess of Warren Buffett and his team. Long-time Berkshire shareholders have confidence that the company's legacy will survive Buffett and keep the stock's history looking favorable for decades to come. 10 stocks we like better than Berkshire Hathaway (A shares)When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) has a long history that goes back nearly a century and a half. Yet like many investment firms, Goldman Sachs was originally set up as a partnership. It was only in 1999 that Goldman decided to go public through an initial public offering, selling nearly $4 billion in stock to the public. At the time, the move was the second-largest IPO in history, and it rewarded its partners with huge windfall. Since then, though, Goldman has only gotten stronger, proving its dominance in the investment banking world and weathering storms that destroyed weaker competitors. Now, Goldman is the most influential stock in the Dow Jones Industrials (DJINDICES: ^DJI), and investors believe that the future remains bright for the investment giant. GS data by YCharts. Goldman Sachs' stock history looks a lot like you would expect, given the perturbations of the financial industry over the past 20 years. Shares of the investment bank soared after its IPO, riding the wave of enthusiasm about the technology boom and the opportunities to provide investment banking advice to a host of new companies. Yet the bear market from 2000 to 2002 and the 9/11 attacks created uncertainty for Goldman that caused it to lose much of the stock's gains during the early 2000s. The strong economic recovery in the mid-2000s gave Goldman a new chance to thrive, and it seized the opportunity soundly. The housing boom in particular was a high point for Goldman, not only because the good times allowed it to participate in the economic expansion, but also because the company ended up making smart bets about the ensuing housing bust. Despite taking plenty of criticism for its handling of its internal investment positions and potential conflicts of interest among various clients, Goldman nevertheless put itself in a more favorable position than many of its banking peers. Image source: Goldman Sachs. In the end, though, Goldman proved vulnerable to the financial crisis, seeing its shares lose about two-thirds of their value between late 2007 and its worst levels in 2008. The investment giant had to seek help from Warren Buffett, who ended up providing $5 billion in badly needed capital to Goldman in exchange for preferred shares and warrants in the bank. Goldman agreed to pay a 10% dividend on the preferred stock, a high price that reflected the scarcity of investment capital during the financial crisis. Yet by 2011, Goldman had repaid Buffett for his investment, buying back its preferred stock at a premium. A couple years later, Goldman settled its warrants with Buffett, giving the Oracle of Omaha a roughly 13 million share stake in the Wall Street giant. Still, it took a long time for investors to share in Goldman's optimism about its recovery. For years, the bank traded at a substantial discount to tangible book value, reflecting skepticism about the valuation of Goldman's assets. Yet Goldman made efforts to bolster its stock price, making significant share repurchases that took advantage of the stock's low valuation. Those moves have paid off by helping to accelerate gains. With the economy moving forward more aggressively, Goldman hopes that its broad-based investment portfolio will thrive. At the same time, rising merger and acquisition activity give the investment bank a chance to boost its service-related revenue, and a more favorable outlook for interest rates could help Goldman increase its profit margin and get a more balanced contribution of sales and profits from all of its banking operations. Goldman Sachs faced the same challenges as other financial giants in surviving the financial crisis and finding a path to recovery. Despite joining its peers in paying billions in settlements related to the housing meltdown, Goldman has largely restored its reputation as an elite Wall Street player, and that should give the company every opportunity to participate in the growth of the industry going forward. 10 stocks we like better than Goldman SachsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy Warren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) has a track record of exceptional performance. In fact, over the past 50 years, Berkshire's stock has risen at an annualized rate of 20.8%. No stock capable of these returns is without risk, but if you're a long-term investor, you may be surprised at how low-risk Berkshire Hathaway is. Image Source: The Motley Fool. Berkshire CEO Warren Buffett has made it clear to potential investors many times that Berkshire Hathaway can be a risky stock to own over short periods of time. In his 2015 letter to shareholders, Buffett mentioned just a few examples of risk factors that the company's businesses face: Buffett also wrote in a separate letter that for investors who plan to sell within a year or two, he can't promise a gain, no matter what the entry price is. Due to circumstances beyond Berkshire's control (such as the financial crisis), the stock has experienced large, rapid drops before, and will certainly do so again at some point. Buffett also points out that none of the risk factors are critical to the company's long-term well-being. In fact, when Buffett took over Berkshire Hathaway in 1964, it was simply a textile business, and one that Buffett knew would disappear one day. However, the company adapted, and has continued to do so ever since. Berkshire will also be financially solid, no matter what. Most of Berkshire's businesses have reliable streams of earnings, and the company maintains a cash stockpile of at least $20 billion at all times (currently $85 billion) with no significant short-term cash requirements. In fact, Berkshire has historically been able to do extremely well during the toughest economic times because of its financial strength. Over the long term, Berkshire's business model virtually ensures that the company (and its stock) will do well. Berkshire's number one goal is to continually increase the earning power of the company, which it attempts to do in five ways: For this reason, and because there is no way to reliably predict what the stock market will do next, Buffett recommends that you only buy Berkshire shares if you plan to hold them for at least five years. Additionally, he warns against purchasing Berkshire shares with borrowed money, pointing out that the stock has fallen by 50% from its highs before, and could certainly do so again someday. Such a drop wouldn't be fun for any shareholder, but could be a disaster for investors using leverage. It's tough to say that one time is better than another, because as I've discussed, the stock price of Berkshire is almost certain to climb over the long run. The company doesn't pay a dividend, and has no plans to, so this means that all of the profits are used to increase the intrinsic value of the company. Having said that, Berkshire does typically trade in a pretty consistent price-to-book range. BRK.B Price to Book Value data by YCharts Buffett has said that he would consider the stock to be extremely cheap at 1.2 times book value, at which point Berkshire would happily buy back its own stock. In fact, he said that buybacks at this level ""would instantly and meaningfully increase per-share intrinsic value for Berkshire's continuing shareholders."" On the other hand, Buffett has also called the stock expensive (from a short-term perspective) when it approaches two times book value. At that price level, Buffett has said, it could potentially be many years before the investor could realize a profit. As I write this, Berkshire trades for 1.47 times book value, making it neither cheap nor expensive in a historical context -- although, if anything, it's a little on the cheaper side. Speaking of expensive and cheap stock, it's worth noting that there are two classes of Berkshire stock available to investors. The Class A shares are the original Berkshire shares and are much more expensive -- as of this writing, they trade for more than $238,000 per share. The Class B shares are the ones accessible to most investors, and they represent 1/1500 of the equity of the A shares, and therefore trade for about the same fraction of their price, about $158. Iif you plan to hold Berkshire shares for the long haul, you don't need to obsess over the valuation. One suggestion: dollar-cost averaging into a position in Berkshire is a smart way to go -- this way you'll buy more shares when it's cheap and fewer when it's expensive. In fact, this is how I've built my own position in the stock without worrying about whether it was a good time to buy. 10 stocks we like better than Berkshire Hathaway When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy On one of the first pages of every Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) annual report is a table that compares the company's performance to the change in the S&P 500 for each year since 1965, the year Warren Buffett took control of Berkshire. It's on this page where one can observe firsthand the power of compounding returns. Over the past 50 years, the compound annual gain in Berkshire's book value per share was 19%. The gain on its stock came in slightly above this, with a compound annual return of 20.8%. The latter translates into a total gain of just under two million percent. Think of it like this: A $10,000 investment in Berkshire Hathaway stock in 1965 would be worth $88 million today. After adjusting for inflation, this means that Warren Buffett took enough money to buy a mid-level BMW and turned it into generational wealth for early shareholders. The same investment in the S&P 500 would be worth $1.3 million. Warren Buffett, the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway. Image source: The Motley Fool. Another thing you can do with the data from this page of Berkshire's annual report is to track the trend in the company's performance. There are a number of ways you can do this, but what I've found most insightful is to chart the trend in Berkshire's annual stock performance compared to the S&P 500. This is Berkshire's alpha, its excess return over the broader market: Data source: Berkshire Hathaway's 2016 annual report. Chart by author. This shows that Berkshire's best days were in the late 1970s, a tumultuous decade thanks to wildly fluctuating energy prices and rapidly accelerating inflation. Since then, Berkshire's performance relative to the S&P 500 has steadily narrowed. Most recently, the rolling five-year average of Berkshire's alpha dipped into negative territory in three out of the past five years. There are a lot of things one can point to for causing this drop. From 1999 through 2001, for instance, Berkshire was absorbing billions of dollars' worth of unexpected losses that it inherited in its 1998 acquisition of General Re, one of the world's leading reinsurers. These losses weighed on the rate of change in Berkshire's book value per share for years, which would be reflected in its stock price. Additionally, Berkshire issued 272,000 shares to make the acquisition, increasing Berkshire's outstanding share count by 21.8%. It was this decision to dilute then-existing shareholders that led Buffett to quip in his latest letter: ""Today, I would rather prep for a colonoscopy than issue Berkshire shares."" Then, of course, came the financial crisis, which caused Berkshire's book value per share to drop for only the second time since Buffett took over in 1965. The only other time was in 2001, when Berkshire's General Re was flooded with reinsurance claims triggered by the terrorist attacks in September of that year. Also working against Berkshire is its growing size, a point Buffett has pointed out in the past. It has the fourth largest market capitalization on the S&P 500, behind only Apple, Alphabet, and Microsoft. It also owns a vast assortment of subsidiaries, from home builders to car insurers to restaurants. The net result is that Berkshire's annual returns theoretically should, and increasingly are, mirroring that of the economy and thus the broader market.Buffett has said this would happen. He's obviously right. 10 stocks we like better than Berkshire Hathaway (A shares)When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy Once every three months, institutional investors have to file a form 13F to disclose the investments in their portfolio. These filings give Average Joes an opportunity to ""steal"" investment ideas from legendary investors like Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-A)(NYSE: BRK-B) or Renaissance Technologies' Medallion Fund. But before you rush out to buy what the legends are buying for their portfolios, it's important to understand the investor you want to copy, and the limitations of regulatory filings. Join The Motley Fool's Gaby Lapera and Jordan Wathen as they discuss the ups and downs to form 13F filings in this segment of Industry Focus: Financials. A full transcript follows the video.

Click here to get access to the full list! *Stock Advisor returns as of February 6, 2017 This podcast was recorded on March 20, 2017. Gaby Lapera: I had anonymous write in and ask, they have a name but, you know, ""Should I base my investments on 13Fs?"" This question needs to be broken down a little bit, starting with, what is a 13F. Jordan Wathen, a softball question for you. Jordan Wathen: All right, one of my favorite regulatory filings. A 13F is a filing that large investors or funds have to file, and they have to disclose their holdings at a point in time at the end of the quarter four times a year. That's as simple as I can say it. But they only disclose their long positions, so, they only disclose what they own, not necessarily what they're short selling. So, with hedge funds, you have to be a little bit careful. Lapera: Yeah, and the type of people who have 13Fs are, like, George Soros or Warren Buffett or, like you said, hedge funds. So, I think that's why the person asked this question, because it is, in theory, these people who have some sort of deep insight into the market. You know what I mean? Wathen: Right, that's why anybody looks at them. I would be lying if I said I didn't, because I really want to reverse engineer a great investor's process. I look at it and try to figure out how they're shaping their portfolio, and if I can learn something, why not, it takes 10 minutes to look at a 13F, so I, of course, do. Lapera: But, the short story on this question -- which is, to remind you, ""should I base my investments on 13Fs"" -- is no, you shouldn't. Wathen: No. I actually want everyone who's listening to this to google this. It's called The Medallion Fund, and it's managed by Renaissance Technologies. It's the greatest hedge fund of all time, period, end of discussion, ungodly returns. I'm talking like 30% a year. They only have one losing year since 1988, and it wasn't 2008, it was 1999. But, they've blown it out of the water. But if you look at their 13F, you will learn nothing, because The Medallion Fund trades in and out of stocks more often than you change your socks on your feet. They trade constantly. So the point in time snapshot which you get from a 13F has actually no value whatsoever. Lapera: Yeah, and that's exactly why you shouldn't be making these long-term investing decisions on what's going on with the 13F. I think one of the most popular people to look at is Warren Buffett. Recently -- you told me this when we were talking about it before the show -- he bought ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM), and he said he bought it because it was better than having that money in cash. Wathen: Yeah, at the Daily Journalannual meeting, Charlie Munger basically said, ""Do you know why we bought ExxonMobil? We thought it was better than cash."" And they literally held it for less than two years. If you think about what Buffett does and what Berkshire Hathawaydoes, they're trying to beat the market over long periods of time. But if you don't understand that nuance, you might look at it and say, ""Oh, ExxonMobil, they bought it, it must be great, they're trying to beat the market,"" when in actuality, all they wanted to do was beat a savings account. There are so many investments to do that. So, I think you really just have to understand who's filing the 13F, first of all, and second of all, what is the goal with the stocks that they buy? With Berkshire, it's changed so much. They used to want to smash the market, and now, apparently, they're really just trying to be the savings account, which is a really low threshold. Lapera: Yeah. It's also hard because Berkshire Hathaway, like we talked about earlier with those really big companies that have trouble out-performing how they did historically, Berkshire Hathaway has the exact same problem. Wathen: Right. I'm not trying to give Berkshire a hard time. I can see, they're probably thinking, dividend incomes, tax at a lower rate, those kinds of things. I'm not trying to rag on Buffett. He's the most successful investor of all time. I don't know if anyone will ever top him. But if you follow him now, he's investing much differently than he did in the 1980s and 1990s, what he's really known for. Lapera: Yeah. Again, short story to, ""should I base my investments on 13Fs"" is no. And if you want, I'm more than happy to send you an article on this. We write approximately a million every year. That might be a mild exaggeration. But it feels like that, because I edit it all of them. Wathen: You just have to look at them as shopping lists. You still need to do your own analysis, but I don't think it's ever bad to look at what a great investor is buying and try to understand why. I actually think that's a really productive use of your time. Lapera: Yeah, definitely. And it's definitely also really interesting to get a stack of 13Fs together, historical 13Fs, and see what's going on over time. But yeah, you should not base your entire portfolio around what one person, or even a set of really good investors, is doing, because you have no idea what's going on in their mind. They're just saying what they own, not why they own it. Wathen: And that's the thing, too. Because they don't report short sales, it's really important that you are really careful about how much weight you put on to it, because someone could be long Wal-Mart and short Target, to have neutral to retail, but they don't really love Wal-Mart that much. They just love it more than Target. It's a pair straight, but you would never know the opposite side of it with a 13F. Lapera: The other thing to keep in mind is that it's kind of a snapshot of an investor's portfolio. They could exit the position the day after 13Fs are out, and you wouldn't know until the next 13F comes out. And, those come out about once a quarter, in case you're curious. But you don't really 100% know exactly what's in there based on the 13Fs. Gaby Lapera has no position in any stocks mentioned. Jordan Wathen has no position in any stocks mentioned.

President Trump on Monday revived his favorite nickname for Sen. Elizabeth Warren -- Pocahontas -- during a White House event to honor Navajo code talkers. The president hosted the event to honor the veterans who used their native language during World Wars I and II to protect the U.S. during battle. Youre very, very special people. You were here long before any of us were here, Trump said in the Oval Office. But his comments took an unexpected turnto the Democratic senator from Massachusetts. Although we have a representative in Congress who they say was here a long time ago. They call her Pocahontas, Trump said. But you know what? I like you. Because you are special. Trump has repeatedly mocked Warren for claims she has made about being part Native American. But Trump's jab on Monday was met with a backlash from critics who said the president should not have used this forum to toss around that nickname. These code talkers deserve our nations praise and gratitude, not a president who disrespects the Native American community and dishonors Native American veterans, Democratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez said in a statement Monday. What Trump displayed today was an embarrassment to our values and a disgraceful insult to the heroes of our history. Our country deserves better than this. But White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders defended the presidents comments after being grilled by reporters over why the president felt the need to say something offensive during the press briefing on Monday. I think what most people find offensive is Senator Warren lying about heritage to advance her career, Sanders said. When asked whether it was a racial slur, Sanders said that was ridiculous. I dont think it is a racist term, I dont think that was his intent, Sanders said. Senator Warren was offensive when she lied about something to advance her career. Warren responded to Trump on MSNBC after the event, saying that it was deeply unfortunate that the president of the United States cannot even make it through a ceremony honoring these heroes without having to throw out a racial slur. Donald Trump does this over and over thinking somehow he is gonna shut me up with this, Warren said. It hadnt worked in the past, it is not gonna work in the future. Warrens claims of Native-American heritage originated during her Senate campaign. She was ultimately unable to prove she is Native American.

Lorraines attorney claims the family had no knowledge of the allegations. (Getty) The real-life demonologists that The Conjuring horror film franchise is based on may have been keeping a creepy secret. The Hollywood Reporter revealed on Wednesday that legal filings and recordings they obtained show top studio executives of the movie franchise were made aware of allegations that Ed Warren (depicted by Patrick Wilson) initiated a relationship with an underage girl with his wife Lorraines (Vera Farmiga) knowledge. THE 15 SCARIEST MOVIES OF THE LAST 15 YEARS The Conjuring movies tell the story of a married couple of paranormal investigators who work together to help people terrorized by ghosts and demons. Judith Penney, now in her 70s, reportedly said in a sworn declaration she lived in the Warrens' house as Eds lover for four decades. She said the relationship started when she was just 15. The magazine noted its unclear whether Warner Bros. took any action in response to the allegations. 2016s The Conjuring 2 depicts the Warrens as a happy couple in a conventional marriage. An attorney for the studio claimed in court papers that a disgruntled author and a producer are suing over profits from the franchise and are spreading rumors as part of a vendetta. Ed died in 2006 and Lorraine Warrens attorney, Gary Barkin, claimed the family had no knowledge of the allegations. Barkin told The Hollywood Reporter that Penney wasnt Eds secret lover. The Warrens opened their home to Ms. Penney when she was 18 and had nowhere else to live following a childhood of neglect, wrote the attorney. During much of their career, Ed and Lorraine were on the road, working on cases and giving lectures  and Ms. Penney lived and watched their house. Lorraine, now 90, is suffering from declining health, her lawyer said. Penney is reportedly not involved with the litigation over the films. The Hollywood Reporter said Ed Warren was in his mid-30s when he allegedly first met a teenage Penney. At the time he was working as a city bus drive in Monroe, Connecticut to make ends meet. In a legal declaration she provided in November 2014, Penney claimed she and Ed began an amorous relationship and by 1963, she moved into the Warrens home where she allegedly had a sexual relationship with Ed. In 1963, Penney was arrested after a concerned citizen reported her relationship with Ed to local police, according to the Hollywood Reporter. She eventually was ordered by the court to attend a delinquent youth office for a month. Penney insisted Ed would pick her up from school every week and then drive her to the mandated meetings. To cover their tracks, the Warrens allegedly claimed she was a either a niece or a poor girl they had taken in out of charity. Penney alleged that in 1978 she became pregnant with Eds child, but was persuaded by Lorraine to have an abortion to avoid public scandal, which could result in the end of their successful ghost hunting business. Penney also said Ed was abusive to Lorraine. Sometimes Ed would actually have to slap her across the face to shut her up, claimed Penney in a recording. Some nights I thought they were going to kill each other. Penney said her relationship with Ed ended in 2003 and she eventually married. Still, she allegedly remained friendly with Ed until his death. As Im older now, I cant even fathom why Lorraine let me stay there, she said in a recording. Lots of times I think about, Why did I do this? Why did I screw up my life like this? Sometimes I get angry thinking about it, how so much was taken away from me.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) has a stockpile of nearly $100 billion in cash on its balance sheet, and is actively searching for ways to use it. With that in mind, and to get investors to appreciate the sheer enormity of this amount of money, let's take a look at some companies with market values less than Berkshire's current spending power. In its first-quarter earnings report, Berkshire revealed that it holds about $96.5 billion in cash and equivalents such as Treasury securities, the most the company has ever held. Image source: Getty Images. Furthermore, it's important to point out that Berkshire's cash hoard is much more usable than the cash stockpiles of many other companies, as virtually all of it is held in the United States. For example, Apple recently reported a staggering $256.8 billion cash hoard, but the vast majority of is held overseas, and would therefore be subject to hefty repatriation taxes if the company were to bring it home to use for an acquisition. So, for the moment at least, it doesn't represent as much purchasing power as it seems. On the other hand, Berkshire could put its cash to work tomorrow fairly easily -- and it would, if the right deal came along. Warren Buffett hates having assets in cash, especially in the current low-interest environment, and would love to use Berkshire's cash to add value for shareholders. Now, Berkshire would never spend all of its cash. Buffett feels it's very important to keep a significant amount of cash, in order to take care of any short-term needs Berkshire may have. He's said several times that the absolute minimum level of cash he'd be comfortable with is $20 billion, which still gives a usable cash stockpile of $76.5 billion. Just to put this amount of cash into perspective, consider what companies Berkshire could acquire in cash, tomorrow, based on each company's current equity market capitalization.(Note: These market values are simply based on each company's market cap as of May 8, 2017, and don't include any debt held by each company. In addition, in an actual acquisition, the price paid by an acquirer will typically represent a premium over the market value of the company's stock.) To name a few, Berkshire could buy: Whether Berkshire would actually be interested in buying any of these companies is another matter, but this certainly illustrates the enormity of Berkshire's cash hoard. In response to a question asked by an analyst at Berkshires annual shareholder meeting abouthow much cash the company needs to have on hand in order to meet its regulatory requirements, Buffett and Charlie Munger acknowledged that Berkshire could potentially spend significantly more than its $96.5 billion cash hoard. In fact, Munger feels that Berkshire could potentially do a $150 billion deal tomorrow if it wanted to, if it were willing to take on debt and/or sell some stocks in order to fund the deal. Buffett responded that he thinks the number is somewhat lower, but he agrees that there is the capacity to do a big purchase. However, keep in mind that in order for Berkshire to be willing to max out its purchasing power, we'd have to be talking about a pretty compelling deal. As Buffett puts it, ""If we find a really big deal that makes compelling sense, we're going to do it."" Assuming Munger is right, take a look at a few of the companies Berkshire could feasibly acquire: To be perfectly clear, I don't actually think Berkshire is going to buy Mastercard or McDonald's anytime soon. I'm just trying to illustrate Berkshire's massive spending ability. However, it's also important to point out that Berkshire is actively looking for ways to put its money to work, so an acquisition of this magnitude isn't out of the question. The main reason Berkshire has as much cash as it does is a lack of attractive opportunities. I expect Berkshire to actively search for its next big acquisition, and if one doesn't come, the company has said it would possibly raise its buyback threshold and repurchase some shares, or even pay shareholders a dividend for the first time. The bottom line is that there are many different ways Berkshire could ultimately decide to put its cash to work, so we'll just have to wait and see. As a Berkshire shareholder myself, there's nobody I'd trust more with $96.5 billion than Warren Buffett and his team, and I'm excited to see what they can do with it. 10 stocks we like better than Berkshire HathawayWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy Insurance stocks can be a good way to get dividends and growth in your portfolio, and there are many insurers trading at particularly attractive valuations right now. Good insurance stocks are stable, low-risk, and can actually prosper as interest rates rise. With that in mind, here are three attractive insurers you can buy right now: Company Symbol Stock Price (2/7/2017) Dividend Yield MetLife MET $51.50 3.1% Markel MKL $913.00 N/A Berkshire Hathaway BRK-B $162.85 N/A Prices and dividends are current as of 2/7/17. MetLife (NYSE: MET) is the largest U.S. life insurer, with one of the strongest brand names in the insurance industry and an excellent distribution network. The company has a variety of life insurance offerings, and about one-third of its earnings come from Latin America, Asia, and other foreign markets, which are expected to be big drivers of growth going forward. Image source: Getty Images. As I write this, MetLife is trading for just 9.7 times consensus estimates for its 2017 earnings, making it a cheap stock, even after the post-election rally. Speaking of the election, While MetLife has already been a beneficiary of the Trump rally, there could still be much more room to climb if the new administration follows through with its promises and achieves its objectives. For instance, job and wage growth could translate into more group life insurance sales. Rising interest rates, which are widely expected over the next few years, would translate into higher investment income. And, de-regulation of the insurance industry should save MetLife lots of money in compliance expense and make it generally easier for the company to do business. In a nutshell, MetLife can be a great way to get into a cheap stock that could have some very strong years ahead of it. While it's technically not a pure insurance stock, that's exactly why I suggest Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) for investors who want a piece of the insurance business. On the insurance front, Berkshire has several subsidiaries, including the massive GEICO as well as General Re, Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group, and several others. CEO Warren Buffett refers to the property-casualty insurance business as ""the engine that has propelled our expansion since 1967."" And, Berkshire's insurance managers are good at what they do. Unlike many insurers, which rely solely on their investments for profits, Berkshire has run an underwriting profit for the past 13 years in a row. And, the same benefits MetLife could enjoy over the next few years also apply to Berkshire's insurance businesses. What makes Berkshire unique is that it uses its insurance proceeds to invest in a variety of other businesses and investments. As of this writing, Berkshire has about 60 fully owned subsidiaries (including its insurance companies) that include such household names as Fruit of the Loom, Duracell, Pampered Chef, and many others. And, Berkshire has a massive and diverse stock portfolio that includes large stakes in Wells Fargo, Coca-Cola, IBM, and American Express. The bottom line is that Berkshire gives you exposure to GEICO's fantastic insurance operation as well as a well-rounded investment portfolio all in a single stock. I've written before that if I could only own one stock, Berkshire Hathaway would be it, and I continue to feel that way. Markel (NYSE: MKL) has been referred to as a mini-Berkshire many times, and for good reason. The company uses the same general business model as Warren Buffett does at Berkshire, using the cash from its insurance businesses to buy stocks and entire companies. However, Markel is a small fraction of Berkshire's size and still relies more heavily on its insurance businesses. The company's revenue over the past 12 months was $5.6 billion, and only about $1 billion of that amount came from Markel Ventures, the part of the business that holds Markel's non-insurance subsidiaries. Markel is a specialty insurer, meaning it insures against unusual risks and offers unique insurance products. For example, Markel serves such niche markets as workers' comp, classic car and boat insurance, healthcare practice, and horse insurance, just to name a few. As far as investments go, much of the company's cash pool is invested in bonds, as is the case with all insurance companies. However, the company also invests in a well-rounded portfolio of common stocks, including names such as Facebook, Alphabet (Google), Disney, and even Berkshire Hathaway. Markel could be an opportunity to get in on a Berkshire-like business model while it's still in the early innings of growth. 10 stocks we like better than Berkshire HathawayWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy Vanguard 500 Index Investor(NASDAQMUTFUND: VFINX),Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF(NYSEMKT: VIG), and General Electric (NYSE: GE) all deserve a spot in your long-term retirement accounts, according to Motley Fool contributors. These three investments offer investors an intriguing opportunity to benefit from expanding global markets, and importantly, all three provide dividend payments that won't be taxed until they're withdrawn from accounts in retirement. Keith Noonan(S&P 500):The best stocks for your 401(k) will vary depending on how your plan is structured, what funds and stocks it supports, and how much you have available to invest, but the Vanguard 500 Index represents one of the best all-around options for your retirement -- and one that has wide support from employer plans. It also has the endorsement of Warren Buffett, who has identified low-cost S&P 500 funds as his preferred investment vehicle and singled out VFINX for recommendation. Image source: Getty Images. While it might seem somewhat counterintuitive, actively managed funds that aim to beat the market have a poor track record of outperforming their benchmarks and typically carry high maintenance fees that eat into returns. Index funds, on the other hand, are built to match market returns, typically have lower expense ratios, and provide broad diversification that greatly reduces the risks associated with being too heavily invested in one company or industry. As the name suggests, the Vanguard 500 Index tracks the S&P 500 index, which means that this fund will give investors a position in the largest publicly traded U.S. companies and exposure to a wide variety of sectors. It also packs a comparatively low expense ratio, with the annual management fee of 0.16% for Vanguard 500 investor class shares coming in 84% lower than the average fund with similar holdings. Brian Stoffel(Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF): Dividends aren't all that exciting over the short-run. But your 401(k) is not a short-term investment vehicle. It is designed to grow over as many as four decades. As such, it's important to visualize just how important dividends are. To highlight my case, let's look at cigarette maker Altria (NYSE: MO). If we look at the company's stock performance over the past thirty years (blue line), it's nice, but not all that impressive. However, when we look at the total return (orange line) of a thirty-year investment in the company, it is jaw-dropping. The difference is explained solely by the reinvestment of dividends. MO data by YCharts. But I'm just using Altria as an example. Instead of putting too many of your eggs in one dividend stock, I think the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETFis a great option https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundIntExt=INT&FundId=0920#tab=0 for your 401(k). The fees on this ETF are very low -- just 0.09% of your investment per year. And by investing in the fund, you'll have access to 186 stocks that share a key trait: they have a track record of raising their dividends every year. The power of those dividend raises can produce a wealth-creating machine within your 401(k). Todd Campbell (General Electric):While ETFs can be a great way to get exposure to a lot of stocks all at once, it can be a good idea to include individual stocks in long-haul portfolios like 401(k)'s too. In constructing any well-balanced portfolio, it helps to begin with some core stocks with proven, been-there-done-that track records. In my view, General Electric is one of those corner stone type stocks. The company is a global infrastructure and energy titan, and including it in portfolios provides instant exposure to both developed and emerging markets worldwide. Given expanding global populations and economies, that kind of exposure should reward General Electric investors plenty over the coming decades. Owning General Electric stock may make sense in the short-term, too. America could be on the cusp of its biggest infrastructure and energy spending program since the 1950s, and you can bet that General Electric will capture its fair share of that spending. Also, while General Electric is best known for being a leader in so called ""old"" economy solutions, like power and transportation equipment, it's carving out an important spot in the ""new"" economy too. The company's investing in new manufacturing processes like 3-D printing, and management thinks rising demand for itsdigital products and services can catapult sales for them from $5 billion in 2015 to $15 billion in 2020. Overall, General Electric's got a lot of irons in the fire and the global scale to warrant a spot in portfolios, especially since shares yield 3.2%. 10 stocks we like better than General ElectricWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy Most Americans, as well as millions of other people around the world, are familiar with American Express (NYSE: AXP), mainly because of its charge and credit card products. However, the company has a history that dates back nearly 170 years, and many people don't know much about Amex's roots and its products, many of which are structured differently than traditional credit cards. American express was formed in 1850 as an express mail business, after three express mail companies combined: The first two are the same two people who founded Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC), which was formed two years later in 1852, when some of American Express' directors opposed expansion into California. Image Source: American Express. For the first 108 years of its history, American Express wasn't in the charge or credit card business. I mentioned that American Express was founded as an express mail business, but the company has also operated in several other areas over the years. To name some of the most significant: I'll save you the math. This translates to a total of $1.9 trillion spent on American Express cards in 2016 alone. In fact, this volume accounted for nearly 23% of the total credit card transaction volume in the United States. The most well-known product issued by Amex is arguably the American Express Platinum card, which was the first premium credit card product when it was introduced in 1984, and continues to be seen as a prestigious and high value card. The platinum card was the successor to the American Express Gold Card, which was introduced in 1966, and remains a popular product issued by Amex today. And, the ultra-exclusive Centurion, or black, card, which has a $7,500 initiation fee and $2,500 annual fee, is considered to be the world's most high-end credit card. If you don't have one of these three cards, you may not know that they're not exactly ""credit cards."" Specifically, these are charge cards, meaning that the balance is to be paid off every month, as opposed to credit cards, which allow you to carry a balance and pay interest. In recent years, an extended-pay option has been added to these cards, but for the most part, they are still charge cards. According to Interbrand, American Express is the 25th most valuable brand in the world. In fact, the value of the American Express brand name alone is estimated to be about $18.4 billion. This is one of the major reasons Warren Buffett is a major investor in Amex, as a strong brand gives a company pricing power and a ""wide economic moat"" that can help prevent the company from losing market share. Many investors have questioned why Buffett has stuck with Amex, since its ""business model is under attack,"" as Buffett himself put it. The rock-solid American Express brand name could be the reason. 10 stocks we like better than American ExpressWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. To walk around Long Beach and see, hear, or talk about a superstar is not uncommon. Long Beach Poly High School alone has produced the likes of Snoop Dogg, Nate Dogg, and Warren G, and boasts over a dozen current and former NFL players includingWillie McGinest, DeSean Jackson, and, most recently, Juju Smith-Schuster. As luck would have it back in 1996, the paths of Long Beach Poly football and one of hip-hop'sgreatest icons would cross on a fateful day in September. To most rap fans, Sept. 7, 1996, will forever be remembered as the day Tupac Shakur was fatally shot to death. But in a story nearly lost to the history of that day, Bleacher Report's Jeff Pearlmantracked down the members of the 1996 Long Beach Poly football teamto recount their near standoff with mortalityas they encounteredShakur hours before his deathat a Barstow, California In-n-Out on their way home from a loss in Las Vegas: With the help of members of that Long Beach team, Pearlman recounts the surreal story and the players near brush with tragedy. There is a reason why Snoop Dogg and Nate Dogg have done so many collaborations: Long Beach Poly attracts talent, and when on campus, the talent attracts talent. This has also been the case in athletics asthe football program has been built into a national powerhouse and sends handfuls of athletes to colleges on full-ride scholarships each year. The stars that Poly has produced, too, never stray far from their roots. Snoop Dogg's 'Snoop Youth Football League' pipelines players to Poly and other high school's in the Greater Long Beach area. For the musical talent from Long Beach, the 1990s proved to be the most successful decade as two heavyweights Snoop Dogg and Nate Dogg paired with Compton collective N.W.A.: Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, Eazy E, and D.J Yella, all culminating in the founding of Death Row Records -- a record label known most notably for the personalities of Suge Knight and Tupac. Similarly, the Long Beach Poly football program began its dominance of the CIF in the same era. The soon-to-be college and NFL players of the 1996 Long Beach Poly football team identified with the rise to prominence of the famous and local rappers, but could also relate to them on a deeper level. The life experiences expressed through Tupac's music wereaccessible to the young Long Beach Poly players, but on that day, they were confronted with the difference between a life of falling victim to those experiences and finding a catharsis through sport. It seems that Tupac only speaks the truth in his lyrics: ""Worldwide, let them recognize from Long Beach to Rosecrans,"" the Poly football team was allowed to recognize, but they should have known to recognize the ""Flossing, but have caution.""

Image source: OnInnovation via Flickr. Copyright 2010 The Henry Ford. Republished under CC BY-ND 2.0. There is a simple reason I won't buy shares of Tesla Motors Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA): I don't trust founder-CEO Elon Musk. Let me explain. It's not that I think Musk is fundamentally dishonest, but rather that his grand unifying vision for his company has blinded him to his responsibility to minority shareholdersand to the risks he is asking them to bear. The Tesla Motors acquisition-rescue of SolarCity Corp. is all the evidence I need to support that proposition. In a deal with as much potential for conflict of interest as this one, I think Musk had a personal obligation to spell out the enormous risks associated with the acquisition in a clear and forthright manner, instead of letting the lawyers address them in legalese in the pages of a securities filing. He didn't. If you're reading this article, I assume you're probably familiar with the conflicts of interest I refer to above, but let me recap the most obvious ones for those readers who aren't: Allow me to draw on one of the lessons that 50 years of stewardship of Berkshire Hathaway taught CEO Warren Buffett. As he wrote in his golden anniversary annual letter (emphasis mine): Tesla gave away 0.11 of its shares for every SolarCity share. Here is what I think they received in return, in terms of intrinsic value: zero. That's what I think SolarCity is worth as a going concern. It isn't profitable, either under GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) or on a cash basis. The most recent estimates have SolarCity recording an accounting loss of close to a billion dollars in 2017, following an estimated $925 million loss in 2016. By the end of the third quarter of 2016, SolarCity's cash had declined to $259 million from $373 million 12 months prior -- despite having issued debt and equity totaling $849 million (net basis) over that period. Yet Tesla touted as a financial benefit of the acquisition that it ""is expected to be additive to Tesla's cash balance... We expect SolarCity to add more than half a billion dollars in cash to Tesla's balance sheet over the next 3 years."" Here's to wishing! Apparently, I'm not the only with genuine skepticism regarding the equity value Tesla shareholders received in acquiring SolarCity. In the merger proposal it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Aug. 31, Tesla revealed that fifteen institutional investors had passed on acquiring SolarCity or even simply making an equity investment in it, and that the company was facing a liquidity squeeze. On its most recent financials, the company's Altman Z-score of -0.20 indicated a significant risk of bankruptcy. With the acquisition by Tesla, SolarCity has found a lifeline such that financial distress is no longer imminent. However, to justify the acquisition on any basis other than as a rescue operation, you have to buy into Musk's vision of the rich synergies between the two businesses. I don't. As New York University finance professor and valuation expert Aswath Damodaran wrote in September: (Note: Tesla shareholders approved the acquisition on Nov. 17, and the deal closed five days later.) Like Damodaran, I'm not a Tesla shareholder. I respect Musk for his entrepreneurial vision and for what he has achieved, but there is a fine line between visionary drive in emerging industries and recklessness. As far as I'm concerned, buying or holding Tesla Motors shares at this point has more to do with blind faith than investing. 10 stocks we like better than Tesla Motors When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. 2025 FOX News Network, LLC. All rights reserved. FAQ - New Privacy Policy With $300 in his pocket, a 24-year-old Phil Knight decided he would travel the world  an idea that lead to founding one of the largest multinational companies in the world: Nike (NYSE:NKE). Most people thought it was crazy. When I finally got going a little bit, people around Portland, Oregon  which is kind of a small city atmosphere in a large city  they said Phil Knight, hes got a Stanford MBA and is selling Japanese sneakers, he told Greta Van Susteren during an interview on the FOX Business Network. But why shoes? Knight said its the one important piece of equipment for a runner. Running shoes are it. My old coach firmly believed that an ounce in a pair of shoes over the course of a mile was worth 10,000 pounds in the last three yards. So he was obsessed with it. And it caught my attention and I became kind of a guinea pig of his own experimental shoes. So it built from there. After acquiring a degree from Stanford, Knight decided to head to Japan to pitch importing running shoes to the United States to Japanese shoemakers Onitasuka Tiger . Wearing my one suit that I owned  all my assets on my back. Im going in there, Im not a natural salesman, I said I may not get out of here alive, he joked. I told them I wanted to import Japanese track shoes into the United States...they were thinking about exporting shoes into the United States. After initial awkwardness we had some interesting dialogue. They brought in some shoes they were working on and there were some things to be really optimistic about... So I ordered I think a dozen pairs of shoes for samples. He also discussed how his former coach became his partner. About December of 1963 they came and I sent a few pairs off to my coach who was really interested in shoes and he said Im coming up to Portland next month, lets have lunch... and I got to lunch with him and I get more than an order, I get the ultimate endorsement. He [said] how about making me your partner?...So I said, Ok Bowerman you [have to] put up $500, well order 300 pairs of shoes, and I would put up $500, he said. Knight would then spend weekends and evenings selling shoes to high school kids. The idea was to get started. So we got 300 in and the next order was 1,000. Thats the way it got going. First year sales were $8,000, he said. A far cry from the $30.6 billion brought in in 2015. He also discussed his financial struggles with banks. I didnt have any real equity for what we were trying to borrow. And the problem with importing in those days was you basically had to put the money up in advance... Its kind of a reversal of what you had to do in your house. You live in your house and you have to pay for it over time. Here you had to pay for it before you got the house... it was a tough financing thing for a long long time. The banks had a nightmare having several thousand pairs of shoes as inventory piled up in their lobby as collateral,  he said. When asked whether he would do it again, he said: Its an entirely different environment now. Theres really sort of negativity towards entrepreneurship and business in general kind of going on in this country... but I see it as a cycle, I dont see it as a trend...The flip side of that is there are venture capital firms now. So you have access to money now that you never had in the 60s, so that makes it easier. He also discussed how Michael Jordan helped the brand. We were probably about $600 million in sales then by about 1984, and we really needed a boost. We thought this young basketball player from North Carolina might be able to help us that way.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy Theres a good bet hell never ride a steer down the streets of Omaha, dance with the University of Nebraska cheerleaders or play the ukulele in front of a crowd of 35,000-plus like his boss, but Greg Abel will most likely do his damnedest to follow exactly what Warren Buffett has done for 53 years: acquire, run and grow businesses that fit right into Berkshire Hathaways DNA. Its one of the most tightly kept secrets in the history of corporate America: Who will succeed Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett when he no longer occupies the conglomerates throne? Many Buffettologists who have studied and scrutinized all things Berkshire believe the affable, 56-year-old Abel, who hails from Alberta, Canada, might just be the eventual ruler of the Berkshire kingdom along with most of its 65-plus businesses. The University of Alberta-trained accountant with a Bachelor of Commerce degree lives and breathes all forms of energy. At the helm of Berkshire Hathaway Energy since 2008, hes diversified and grown what started as a Midwestern electric utility into a natural gas, wind, solar and geothermal power conglomerate. He served as chairman and president of MidAmerican Renewables and has held seats on the boards of companies as diverse as Kraft Heinz to Kern River Gas Transmissions to the American Football Coaches Foundation. Much of the Who will run Berkshire after Buffett guessing game has been just that. Guessing. But in January, a crack in the Berkshire castle gates opened. Thats when Buffett, who 55 years ago bought and turned a failing textile relic called Berkshire Hathaway into a massive conglomerate with some $710 billion in assets, named Abel, along with 67-year-old Ajit Jain, who runs Berkshires widespread insurance operations, as vice chairmen. The move thrilled shareholders and titillated Wall Street. Buffett sees Abel as a rock star, specifically because he has carefully and quietly, but confidently, turned what was MidAmerican Energy into one of the countrys largest power suppliers that generates roughly 10 percent of Berkshire Hathaways earnings. Abel not only has the sentiment and a strong track record at Berkshire, but hes got the kind of solid foundation that speaks slow, steady and stable. He trained as a chartered accountant with PricewaterhouseCoopers in PwCs San Francisco office, before joining geothermal electricity producer CalEnergy in 1992. In 1999, CalEnergy acquired MidAmerican Energy, adopting its name, and Berkshire Hathaway acquired a controlling interest later that year. Abel became CEO of MidAmerican in 2008, and the company was renamed Berkshire Hathaway Energy in 2014. As for Jain, its been said he has generated more profit and more revenue than any other Berkshire employee. Jain helms a gigantic but complicated business of insurance companies, some of which strike multimillion-dollar agreements to take over property risks from other insurance companies. That business alone churns out hundreds of millions of dollars in profits each year---the exact kind of result Buffett expects but doesnt necessarily get from some of his biggest subsidiaries. Buffett has often joked that he wished Jain had a twin brother he could hire as well. Neither man grants interviews, so all Buffettologists have had to go on over the years is the pointed praise Buffett and his longtime business partner, Berkshire vice chair Charlie Munger, have lavished on Jain and Abel once a year at the annual shareholder meetings or in the annual Berkshire shareholder letter. While Jain is considered a genius, its Abel who holds traits most similar to Buffett. Hes based in Des Moines, Iowa, has an easy laugh, and is self-deprecating just as Buffett is known to be, but Abel also has the same killer instinct when it comes to business. In our quest to learn more, FOX Business became the first business network to catch up and speak with Abel. Yours truly, knowing Abel was picked to sound the air horn at the starting line of the annual Invest in Yourself Berkshire 5k run back in May in downtown Omaha, Nebraska, showed up at 7 a.m. to catch a glimpse of the business worlds version of the ghost orchid. We found a totally relaxed Canadian wearing a baseball hat and a race bib with the number 1 on it. As we approached with our camera crew, he immediately fessed up that hed be walking, not running the race. When I suggested attempting to trot it, he laughed, indicating there was a low probability of that happening either. When we got to business, Abel expressed comfort in both his new vice chair role and the diverse businesses from Marmon Holdings to Precision Castparts to Benjamin Moore paints to Dairy Queen to Oriental Trading all now under his watchful eye. Nothings changed, Abel told FOX Business. Business as usual. Its just great. Weve got great people to be working with...couldnt be better. At 88, Buffett is known to use the exact same verbiage when friends call to ask him how hes doing. Couldnt be better. Abel has the advantage of getting a firm grip on his new responsibilities just as the U.S. and global economies find surer footing. The latest reading on U.S. gross domestic product for the second quarter came in at 4.1 percent. Business sentiment is strong and inflation is within a whisker of the Federal Reserves 2 percent target. Well, things are good right now, Abel told FOX Business. So our businesses are in a great place. And weve got great managers and like I said we are moving forward. Some of those managers tell FOX Business working with Abel is already cruising at a good clip. Troy Bader, president and CEO of International Dairy Queen, was newly ensconced when Abel got the nod to run Berkshires non-insurance businesses. With Greg its been wonderful. Hes been very involved. Ive had the opportunity to spend some time with him, and hes a very accomplished individual. Very bright. Has a great understanding already of our business and so many of the industries. Im very much looking forward to learning from him but also having him engaged in the business. But with Greg, its no different from Warren or anyone else: (he) expects us to be managing our business and running them as if they were our own, Bader said. Sees Candies President and CEO Brad Kinstler reported to Buffett for years, first as president of Cypress Insurance Company, then as president and CEO of Fechheimer Brothers, and finally as chief of a Buffett favorite. The Oracle of Omaha is unabashedly obsessed with Sees peanut brittle. At this point there is really no difference (between Buffett and Abel), Kinstler said. Greg is certainly learning the different Berkshire businesses. He and Ajit are going to do great in this role. At this point I havent had to do too much with Greg, but I look forward to spending more time with him. And again there is only one skill I see they might need a little work on. And that would be? In this (new) role you have to be able to consume mass quantities of Sees candy in front of large groups of people. And they may need some more training on that, Kinstler joked. Whether Abel will get the eventual nod is still unknown, but on May 7, Buffett told FOX Business exclusively that the Berkshire board was unanimous in its support of his secret list of potential successors. He would not reveal how many names are on the list, nor whether any had been added or subtracted, at the just-concluded shareholder meeting but he has been clear in telling FOX Business in the past that none of the names are in their 70s. The Oracle of Omaha is adamant that his successor(s) have the stamina and longevity to run Berkshire for many years to come. But perhaps the most intense praise comes from Buffetts business partner and best friend for the past five-plus decades. Berkshire Vice Chairman, 94-year-old Charlie Munger made his opinion of both Abel and Jain crystal clear in the 2015 shareholder letter. Both are proven performers who would probably be under-described as world-class, said Munger in the letter. In some important ways, each is a better business executive than Buffett. It could be some time before either Abel or Jain gets called up. In an interview with FOX Business on his 88th birthday on Aug. 30, Buffett seemed as engaged as hes ever been, quick to weigh in on an analysts musing that under the right terms, Apple might consider buying electric vehicle maverick Tesla. At 251.9 million shares, Apple is the largest stock holding in Berkshires massive portfolio. When asked by FOX Business about an Apple-Tesla prospect, Buffett quipped it would be a very poor idea, adding, It's not an easy business. You can win in auto one year and lose the next. You've got a dozen big companies out there with resources. They're going to keep coming. They're going to copy what you do. Never mind that he could be describing the insurance business or that Berkshire holds a stake in Chinese battery and electric vehicle maker BYD. On top of that, in 2014, Berkshire snapped up Van Tuyl Group, the nations largest privately held auto dealership chain. Buffetts final comment during the interview? I feel great. No matter when, Wall Street has signaled its support of Abel as an eventual chief. The most likely successor in our view, who Warren Buffett regularly praises, is Greg Abel, JPMorgans Sarah DeWitt said in a note released September of last year. DeWitt initiated coverage of the company with an overweight rating. She also wrote that she expects the Oracle of Omaha to remain in charge for another decade, but any selling pressure due to his departure would be a buying opportunity. Perhaps. But with an investment and growth record that remains unbeaten, the question remains whether, after his departure, Berkshire itself can be seen by investors as bigger than the biggest: Warren E. Buffett, the kid from Omaha, the Harvard reject who took a Dale Carnegie course to overcome his shyness and the man who has become arguably the most colorful and greatest investor of both the 20th and, so far, the 21st century.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy Howard Buffett, the grandson of billionaire investing legend Warren Buffett, has some tips for investors who want to buy the stock of socially responsible companies. What we talk about in terms of social value investing is really more about how different partners come together to collaborate, Buffett told Liz Claman during a FOX Business interview on Thursday. Its just as much about a mindset as it is how organizations work together to make the world a better place. According to Howard Buffett, who co-authored the book Social Value Investing, investors should determine what they want to do to make the world a better place and then find a company with similar goals. You have to see what attractive investments fit within that, he said. Buffett said his grandfather expanded Berkshire Hathaway through smart, financially savvy purchases including renewable energy. Its been incredibly lucrative for the business, Buffett said. But in terms of wind and solar, its also doing a lot to make the world a better place. Its a combination of things.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy The chief executives of Americas largest companies saw an increase in pay last year, according to a new study. In its initial report on CEO pay for 2017, Equilar said the top executives at the 100 biggest companies by revenue recorded a median compensation of $15.7 million, up from $15 million. CEOs that made the list earned a median pay boost of 5%, down slightly from the 6% increase reported in the prior year. The study also looked at the ratio of CEO pay versus the median employee, a new disclosure requirement for public companies. Among the 69 companies that have reported data so far, CEOs earned $235 for every dollar earned by the median employee. Manpower Group, a British provider of workplace solutions, had the widest gap of 2,483:1, largely because most of its employees are temporary workers. Warren Buffett had the lowest CEO-to-employee pay ratio of 2:1. The highest-paid CEO is Broadcoms Hock Tan. His total compensation surpassed $103 million, largely thanks to a one-time stock award that will be distributed over time. The chip maker, which recently moved its headquarters from Singapore to San Jose, California, dropped its bid to acquire rival Qualcomm in March amid opposition from the Trump administration. AIG CEO Brian Duperreault ranked No. 2 on the list with 2017 compensation of $42.8 million, followed by Oracle co-CEOs Mark Hurd ($40.8 million) and Safra Catz ($40.7 million). Walt Disney CEO Bob Iger was the fifth highest-paid CEO at $36.3 million, though his compensation fell 11% year-over-year. Rounding out the top 100 is Buffett, who earns a base salary of $100,000. The Oracle of Omahas Berkshire Hathaway booked more revenue than any other publicly traded company last year. Berkshire Hathaways top line grew 8% to $242.1 billion in 2017. Apple was the runner-up in total revenue at $229.2 billion. Its CEO, Tim Cook, earned $12.8 million during the year, up 47%. The Equilar 100 study is based on public filings from the first quarter.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy Billionaire investor Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway Vice Chairman Charlie Munger are doubling down on slamming bitcoin by comparing the cryptocurrency to rat poison and turds. Munger told FOX Business Liz Claman on Monday that bitcoin was rat poison five years ago when the digital currency was trading just above $100 and now refers to it as more expensive rat poison. I like it when my country steps hard on idiot booms instead of fanning the flame, Munger said during an interview on Countdown to the Closing Bell. ""If theres ever anything that needed stepping down on hard, its bitcoin."" Buffett, chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, described digital currency as a nonproductive asset while stocks earn money for investors in the markets. No money has been made from bitcoin where somebody pays somebody else to own the same thing he said. Bitcoin has produced nothing. Munger said investors who are bullish on cryptocurrency are fueling economic consequences that harm the U.S. To me, its just dementia,Munger said Saturday during Berkshire Hathaway annual shareholders meeting in Omaha, Nebraska. Its like somebody else is trading turds, and you decide you cant be left out. A cryptocurrency conference, Bitcoin Day in Omaha, was coincidently scheduled during the same weekend as the Berkshire Hathaway annual shareholder meeting, but organizers had to cancel after the events location host cited conflict with events on the same day. Munger reacted to the cancellation by saying Monday, Well, they were probably crowded out by a couple of people who wanted to have a conference on sewage.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Former child bride Elissa Wall opens up about the part she played in bringing down the 'prophet of evil,' Warren Jeffs. Elissa Wall can still vividly remember when she was forced to marry her 19-year-old first cousin Allen Steed at the age of 14 by a false religious prophet. The former child bride has come forward with her story as part of A&Es documentary Warren Jeffs: Prophet of Evil. The special explores how the now-imprisoned cult leader ruled over an estimated 15,000 followers of the polygamous Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS). The 62-year-old is said to have had 78 wives, more than 50 children and controlled millions of dollars of the church before he was sentenced to life in prison in 2011 for sexually assaulting his 12-year-old and 15-year-old child brides. Wall later became the lead witness in the trial that ultimately put Jeffs in prison. A 2014 Lifetime movie titled Outlaw Prophet starring Tony Goldwyn attempted to shed light on a community ruled by a man who was determined to quell his demands and desires. Wall, now 31, says she is determined to pull back the curtain on the secretive community. I really think at the time it was about submission, Wall told Fox News about the illegal marriage. I could have become a really big problem for the community and for Warren. I was a little more outspoken than the average girl. But I really think it was about pounding me into submission... I was just the next player he wanted to eliminate and to quickly get control over. Wall, who was born into the FLDS church in Utah, was raised by her mother, a multigenerational member whose parents were also part of the sect, as well as her father, a convert from the outside world. But despite her upbringing, Wall described herself as a naturally curious child who felt there was something strange about her community. We led a very secret lifestyle, she described. We didnt interact with the outside world. We didnt go to public school. We were educated, cultivated and bred to be products of the church and the religion. ""I have this one vivid memory being at a beach in northern Utah. I was watching this family play about 500 yards away from us. They looked loving, kind and caring. The mother was hugging and holding her children. They were laughing and they didnt look like these evil disciples of the devil like I have been told they were. So I think my questions really started early on. Washington County Attorney Brock Belnap watches as Elissa Wall (R) talks to the media outside Utah's 5th Judicial District Courthouse in St. George September 25, 2007, after U.S. polygamist sect leader Warren Jeffs was convicted of being an accomplice to rape for arranging a marriage between an unwilling 14-year-old girl, Wall, and her 19-year-old first cousin. Jeffs faces five years to life in prison for each of the two felony charges of accomplice to rape. No date was set for sentencing. (Reuters) Wall described how Jeffs, or Uncle Warren, was an ever-present figure looming over her childhood. Jeffs was the son of the beloved figure Rulon Jeffs. The patriarch died in 2002 at age 92 and it didnt take long for his son to take over. [Warren] was in charge of church history, said Wall. So for a lot of us children who were born into this, our days would be forever listening to these tapes of Warrens voice playing over and over of him teaching us church history. It became the backdrop of our childhood. Still, Wall couldnt ignore what she was seeing. She claimed to have witnessed families be torn apart, her father being sent away and her mother given to another man as a wife. There just had to be a better way, she said. It did not take long for Jeffs to force Wall into marrying Steed in 2001, despite her tearful pleas. Wall insisted she was tortured with various forms of abuse. Defense witness Allen Steed, who was married to the accuser, listens to a question during Warren Jeffs ' trial in St. George Utah September 19, 2007. A Utah judge rejected a motion to dismiss charges against a self-described ""prophet"" of a breakaway Mormon sect that practices polygamy after prosecutors rested their case unexpectedly early on Tuesday. Jeffs, 51, the leader of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, is on trial on two counts of being an accomplice to rape after he presided over a wedding of a 14-year-old girl. (Reuters) Mentally, it was immediate, she said. I was now the property of my cousin. And no matter how resistant I was to him, his job was to get me into submission as quickly as possible... Then the sexual abuse came later as he started to force himself on me and force that my role as a wife was to be at his beck and call and to have his children. ""And when I became resistant to that, then the physical abuse started to take over. And I think the frustration of my cousin, his frustration of being judged for not being a good man because his wife wasnt submissive and she wasnt good  that all compounded the problem. Wall said she reached out to Jeffs multiple times, but her cries for help went on deaf ears. I felt like something was going terribly wrong, she admitted. And so, I would describe these occurrences in detail in hopes that he would validate these deep concerns that I had. Warren Jeffs (L) looks at his attorney during his trial in St. George, Utah, September 19, 2007. A Utah judge rejected a motion to dismiss charges against a self-described ""prophet"" of a breakaway Mormon sect that practices polygamy after prosecutors rested their case unexpectedly early on Tuesday. Warren Jeffs, 51, the leader of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, is on trial on two counts of being an accomplice to rape after he presided over a wedding of a 14-year-old girl. (Reuters) ""But he reprimanded me over and over for not being submissive. Reminding me of my teachings. Reminding me that I was the property of this man and he could do whatever he wanted to me. Wall endured several miscarriages and a still-birth during the nearly-four-year arranged marriage. In 2005, she ran away from the church at age 18. However, something was holding her back. I had two young sisters that I loved with every fiber of my soul that I couldnt protect because there was this giant canyon between us, said Wall. It took me meeting a very important prosecutor and investigators that were kind and trustworthy that I could come forward and begin to tell my story... [But] I had no idea I would end up testifying against Warren. My goal wasnt to take Warren down. My goal was to protect my sisters. In 2006, NPR reported Jeffs was arrested and charged with facilitating polygamous marriages involving underage girls. He had been on the run from criminal charges for more than four months. Wall would face him again in 2007. I remember locking eyes with him for the first time [in court], said Wall. I felt this overwhelming power that consumed my very soul and I refused to drop eyes. That was my stand. If I can keep contact with him, I can prove to myself that he didnt control me... I was liberating myself from his control. I was beginning to free myself from the anger I had towards him. In 2017, The Salt Lake Tribune reported Jeffs was ordered to pay Wall $16 million in damages. Today, Wall is a single mother to a 13-year-old son and an 11-year-old daughter living in Utah. She has since started a children's clothing company. And three years ago, she was finally able to reconnect with her sisters. However, she is not completely in touch with all of her family. Her mother is still in the church. Wall insisted her work is far from over. Shes still eager to help people safely leave behind the FLDS and similar organizations. And shes hoping her participation in the A&E special will further raise awareness. Briell Decker, the 65th wife of jailed Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS Church) polygamist prophet leader Warren Jeffs, walks past an outdoor chimney marked with ""Pray and Obey"" at the compound where he lived for several years, in Hildale, Utah, U.S., May 3, 2017. She is in the process of purchasing the compound. Picture taken May 3, 2017. (Reuters) Its painful sometimes to be out in the open and be vocal about these memories, said Wall. And as painful as it is to be an advocate, to be vocal, to be out there, I see it as a necessary role in bringing about education and awareness... There is a sense of bittersweet sadness that we still have work to do. ""Warren Jeffs: Prophet of Evil"" airs Monday at 9 p.m. on A&E.

(Getty Images) A former Disneyland princess whose ex-fiance is on death row for a bizarre double murder has been found guilty of being an accessory after the fact. Rachel Buffett, 31, was convicted on Wednesday in Orange County, Calif., and ordered jailed immediately. She could face more than 3 12 years behind bars when shes sentenced in November. Prosecutors said Buffett lied to police when they were investigating her then-fiance, Daniel Patrick Wozniak. Senior Deputy District Attorney Matt Murphy alleged Buffett lied, dodged questions and changed her story while being interviewed by detectives who believed Wozniak was involved in two slayings. ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT CHARGED IN STABBING DEATH OF 16-YEAR-OLD GIRL, REPORT SAYS She lies repeatedly, Murphy said. There are little lies and big lies. Prosecutors said Wozniak, 34, a former actor, killed and dismembered Samuel Eliezer Herr, 26, of Costa Mesa in 2010 in order to steal his money to pay for a wedding and honeymoon with Buffett. Wozniak had planned on stealing $62,000 from Herr, who had saved up the cash from when he served in the Army in Afghanistan. Murphy said Google searches from Wozniaks computer in 2010 showed queries like how load shotgun and how to hide a body. Authorities said Wozniak also shot Herrs friend, Julie Kibuishi, 23, then tried to frame the dead man for her murder by making it seem like he killed her and vanished. Daniel Wozniak is serving life in prison after being convicted in December 2015. (AP) A few days after the slayings, Wozniak was arrested at his bachelor party in Huntington Beach, the Los Angeles Times reported. Authorities said Wozniak confessed to the killings and was convicted in December 2015 of two counts of murder and was later sentenced to death. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE MOTIVE INVESTIGATED IN CALIFORNIA RAMPAGE Buffett, a former actress and Disneyland princess, told NBCs Dateline after her ex-fiances arrest that she was innocent, People reported.

Democratic Senator Warren hosts seemingly spontaneous livestream from her kitchen following her announcement that she is filing paperwork to launch an exploratory committee for president; David Spunt reports from Washington. In a seemingly spontaneous livestream posted on Instagram that channeled similar social-media efforts by former Texas Senate candidate Beto O'Rourke and incoming New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren cracked open a beer on-camera and took some questions from her followers on New Year's Eve. Warren announced at a news conference outside her home hours earlier Monday that she was filing paperwork to launch an exploratory committee for president, becoming the first candidate to take the major step toward a 2020 run -- and she reminded her audience that the day had been a break from her normal routine. ""I'm here in my kitchen, uh, and um, I thought maybe we'd just take some questions and I'd see what I can do,"" Warren, 69, began as she looked into a camera apparently set up on a countertop. She continued: ""It's been kind of an amazing day. So, today, I, um, got up early this morning, and, uh, talked to a bunch of folks on the phone, and then went outside and talked to the press -- and this is our house, and has been for a long time, and there are all these reporters, and trucks, and everybody outside the house."" The liberal firebrand pointed to her dog, Bailey, who was also in the kitchen and who accompanied her earlier in the day. ""And I went out and talked to the press, and Bailey went out -- it was his first press conference -- and my husband Bruce [Mann] was with me,"" Warren said. TRUMP, IN EXCLUSIVE NYE INTERVIEW, TELLS FOX NEWS WARREN HAS A 'PSYCHIATRIST' Seconds later, Warren's apparent craving struck: ""Hold on a second -- I'm gonna get me a beer,"" she said, as she walked out of view of the camera. ""Um, want a beer?"" she then asked as her husband briefly entered the room. ""No, I'll pass on a beer for now,"" he responded. Then, matter-of-factly from across the camera as he left the kitchen, he offered a quick farewell: ""Enjoy your beer."" ""Enjoy your beer."" After returning, Warren announced that she has already received donations from individuals all 50 states, as well as D.C. and Puerto Rico. ""It really has been an exciting day,"" she said, as she touted the importance of small donors in politics. ""Fortnite? Good to see you,"" Warren said at one point in the livestream, reading the online handle of one user in the chat, whose name refers to a popular online videogame. The senator then elaborated on her plans for the evening. ""Here it is -- getting ready for New Year's Eve. It's easy for Bruce and I to make plans, because we pretty much do the same things every year,"" Warren said. ""Um, for New Year's Eve we watch Casablanca, we get some good food ... and, um, we sit there upstairs and we watch Casablanca."" She added that the movie ""fills me with hope."" Ocasio-Cortez, 29, popularized the use of Instagram stories and livestreams earlier this year to connect with her supporters. O'Rourke, too, often broadcast himself while in his home cooking and performing other tasks. In November, Corbin Trent, Ocasio-Cortezs communications director, told Rolling Stone that Ocasio-Cortez used social media to separate herself from older politicians. Instagram provides Ocasio-Cortez more capacity for transparency and just to be herself, Trent told the magazine. I think theres a larger comfort level there. But Warren likely will face a more spirited opponent in 2020 than did Ocasio-Cortez, who defeated longtime incumbent Democrat Joseph Crowley in a shocking primary upset in part, analysts said, because he did not take her insurgent candidacy seriously enough. In an exclusive interview set to air during Fox News' 'All-American New Year' special Monday night, President Trump suggested that only Warren's ""psychiatrist"" knew whether she thought she could win the White House in 2020. Trump often has derided Warren for claiming she has Native American ancestry. At a rally in July, he joked that he would pull out a heritage kit during a hypothetical presidential debate with Warren and slowly toss it at her, ""hoping it doesn't hit her and injure her arm, even though it only weighs probably two ounces.""

The 85-year-old star, who has been recently cast in FXs Emmy-winning series, American Horror Story: Apocalypse, told Town & Countrys September 2018 issue she did have one major Hollywood regret. In 1960, I was offered a script called Sons and Lovers' with Dean Stockwell, said Collins. I wanted to do it, and I [didn't] think it was bad. ""However, I was living with and engaged to a young actor called Warren Beatty, who said, This is absolute crap. So I turned it down, and Mary Ure did it and was nominated for an Oscar. At that time I was more influenced by men. Still, the actress didnt always take every advice she was given over the years. Everybody said to me, Youll be through by the time youre 24, said Collins. My father, all these guys in Hollywood... Over and over again, I have been told this by men. But it hasnt been true yet! Joan Collins today.

Still, Collins admitted she was intimidated by one movie legend  Bette Davis. Yes! she said I was 20, she was 50 or something [on the set of 1955s The Virgin Queen and she was not happy.

(Playboy) I was basing her on all the businessmen I knew who were heartless, really, said Collins. The other part of her brain, the glamorous part with the over-the-top clothes, I based on one of my best friends called Cappy Badrutt. She was extremely glamorous, and unfortunately very miserable."" ""But I dont think Alexis was miserable,"" added Collins. ""I think she enjoyed her life and lived it to the fullest. But Collins refuses to look back at her past, claiming she hasnt seen a movie of hers in forever. Instead, shes looking forward to what the future holds for her on television. When I first saw [American Horror Story], I went to my agent and said, I love this show. Can you get me a role in it? explained Collins. Nothing. Then I met Ryan Murphy at the Vanity Fair Oscar party, and we had a lovely conversation, but I really didnt think much more of it. Two weeks later, we go to see Barbra Streisand at the PaleyFest, and I didnt know Ryan was going to be interviewing her. Joan Collins in ""Dynasty.""

FAQ - New Privacy Policy Billionaire investor Warren Buffett seems to be disowning the purchase of Amazon stocks after one of Berkshire Hathaways portfolio managers invested in the e-commerce giant this week. Buffett told FOX Business Liz Claman, I didn't know about it until after it was done, on the eve of Berkshires annual shareholder meeting in Omaha, Nebraska. The Berkshire Hathaway chairman and CEO is referring to the investment transaction executed by either Todd Combs and Ted Wechsler, who manage more than $13 billion in equities for the company. Buffett told CNBC about the share purchases during an interview on Thursday, saying he was an ""idiot"" for not investing in the e-commerce behemoth earlier. Buffett, the 88-year-old Oracle of Omaha, is known for being a disciplined value investor who tries to avoid overpaying -- no matter his feelings on the company.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy Warren Buffett's children are echoing the sentiments of billionaire heirs and heiresses who recently have voiced concerns over the nations wealth imbalance. Peter, Susie and Howard Buffett are putting the onus more on a rising wealth inequality system rather than corporate executives such as Disney CEO Bob Iger, who was paid $65.6 million in fiscal 2018. What are we measuring and what are we rewarding? Because that tells us what the system we are in. I dont think Bob Iger is a bad guy. We are inside a structure that creates it, Peter told FOX Business Liz Claman Thursday. The spotlight on Igers salary highlights how the corporate board has failed shareholders by supporting a pyramid-like salary structure, of which half is nonperformance based. Ive seen CEOs that have gotten paid huge packages a year while they are still employed and their stock has lost money and their revenues are down, Howard Buffett said on the eve of the kickoff of Berkshires annual shareholders' meeting in Omaha, Nebraska. Ive sat on compensation boards or committee on boards that I think they're failing in their duty to the shareholders because you know it's almost like a pyramid screen, Howard Buffett said. You know this guy made $5 billion. Well, then my guy's got to make 6 more. And then in a sign I mean half of it isn't even based on performance."" Abigail Disney, the granddaughter of co-founder Roy Disney, recently spoke at a panel during the Fast Company Impact Council where she called Igers level of compensation insane. Peter Buffett said that despite Iger doing a commendable job as Disneys CEO, he questions the system that allows an excessive pay gap between the United States top executives and their employees. What does it say about a system that rewards [Iger] to that degree and puts somebody that is working for him in a much different position, Peter said.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy At 88 years old, Warren Buffetts infamous all junk food diet hasnt slowed him down one bit. The billionaire admitted in an hour-long interview with the Financial Times that he still gulps down five cans of Coca-Cola a day, eats McDonalds chicken nuggets at least three times a week and loves Dairy Queen ice cream for dessert. Im not bothered by the thought of my death, Buffett told FT, noting that despite his age and poor eating habits, he stills jumps out of bed every morning to go to work and has no plans on retiring any time soon. Buffett, whos company Berkshire Hathaway owns more than $16 billion worth of Cola-Cola shares, estimates that one quarter of his daily calories come from his soda addiction. Im one quarter Coca-Cola, Buffett told Fortune in 2015. If I eat 2700 calories a day, a quarter of that is Coca-Cola. I drink at least five 12-ounce servings. I do it everyday. Berkshire Hathaway chairman Warren Buffett drinks a can of Cherry Coke at the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting in Omaha May 1, 2010. Berkshire Hathaway owns about 8.7 % of Coca-Cola Co. REUTERS/Rick Wilking Buffett said he typically has three cokes during the day and two at night and occasionally treats himself to a cherry coke. As for his favorite snack with a nice cold coke, Buffett admits he loves to snack on UTZ potato sticks. Another one of Buffetts diet pitfalls, is his love for lots of salt. Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf told Bloomberg in 2014 that, When the food comes, Warren grabs a salt shaker in his left hand and one in his right, and its a snowstorm. Despite the criticism, Buffett says his high-sugar, high-salt diet has somehow enabled him to remain relatively healthy.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy Billionaire Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett have been best friends for nearly three decades  though Gates was initially not too keen on meeting the legendary investor. During a New York Times/DealBook conference on Wednesday, Gates spoke about his well-known friendship with Buffett, saying he originally did not think too much of his investing style. I didnt even want to meet Warren because I thought, Hey this guy buys and sells things, and so he found imperfections in terms of markets, thats not value added to society, thats a zero-sum game that is almost parasitic. That was my view before I met him ... he wasnt going to tell me about inventing something, Gates said. BILLIONAIRE BILL GATES ALL FOR HIGHER TAXES, BUT NOT A WEALTH TAX After meeting Buffett in 1991, however, Gates said the Berkshire Hathaway chairman and CEO was one of the only people who asked him obvious, but challenging questions. I realize everything he does is based on a framework of the world where hes judging  judging markets, judging people, judging how things work, in a very deep way, Gates said. I realized we both  although we come from different places  were both trying to model the world and what goes on. BILL GATES JABS ELIZABETH WARREN OVER 'BEEF WITH BILLIONAIRES,' WEALTH TAX Gates said that he was able to learn from Buffett about newspapers, retailers, good investments and bad investments. The two are among the top five richest people in the world. They have also worked together on philanthropic causes, including starting the Giving Pledge, which asks wealthy people who sign on to commit to giving away more than half of their wealth. Buffett has also donated billions to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

Buffet picured in Illinois, interviewing five people in a broken-down vehicle, one of whom reportedly confessed to entering the U.S. illegally twice. (Chad Larner via 50borderstates.com ) Howard Buffett, Warrens oldest son, has become a crusader at the border, using his organizations and wealth to boost security efforts of local authorities and volunteer groups, according to a recent report. While his interest in border security may seem odd, a closer look at the 64-year-old billionaire and philanthropist reveals hes no stranger to the issue. Buffett owns a ranch in Cochise County, Arizona, that sits just 300 yards from the U.S.-Mexico border. In addition, a report by The Phoenix New Times indicated a close relationship between Buffett and law enforcement, with the former reportedly gifting $30 million to date to the Cochise County Sheriffs Office and similar groups. According to the report, much of that money has been used to jump-start an investigative unit into human and drug smuggling, renovate one jail, build law enforcement training facilities, including a shooting range, arm officers, purchase surveillance equipment and even provide the sheriffs office with at least three helicopters. TRUMP SAYS HE HAS ABSOLUTE RIGHT TO DECLARE A NATIONAL EMERGENCY IN FOX NEWS INTERVIEW In 2013 Buffett was awarded the title of special deputy after giving the sheriffs office nearly $1 million in gifts, the paper said. He also reportedly became an active member of the Cochise County Sheriffs Assist Team (SAT), a private volunteer group that is said to provide security and intelligence. It was not clear what role Buffett has in the organization, but he soon became the main source of funding for it, according to the report.

(Howard Buffett via 50borderstates.com) While SAT members are said to have no law enforcement authority, The Phoenix New Times reported that the organization was given guns, armor and vehicles purchased by the sheriffs office using money from Buffett for patrolling purposes. The Cochise County Sheriffs Office did not reply to Fox News request for comment but a public information officer told the paper that while the weapons were purchased for SAT, no member was ever issued a firearm because they all failed to meet certain qualifications. The spokesperson also stated that Buffett has no legal authority in Cochise County, despite being named as Ranch Patrol Liaison Officer [...] with the rank of Deputy Commander in 2016. TRUMP VISITS TEXAS BORDER TOWN AMID PUSH FOR WALL: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT MCALLEN Records obtained by the paper show that Buffett has been involved in patrols and even conducted traffic stops. Buffett has donated throughout the years to Cochise County Sheriffs Office and similar groups through his foundation. The Howard G. Buffett Foundation in Decatur, Illinois, has gifted funds not only to local authorities in Arizona, but also the Macon County Sheriffs Office, where he was also named Civilian Undersheriff"" in 2014, and helped to fund another law enforcement training facility in Macon County, according to the report. The Phoenix New Times obtained emails from the Decatur Police Department that showed that Buffett had taken two members of local law enforcement down to the border with him sometime in early 2016. Those emails reportedly contained surveillance images of what looked to be smugglers crossing Buffetts ranch. Howard Buffett speaking to a rancher whose property sits alongside border fencing in Arizona. (Eric Crowley via 50borderstates.com) The Howard G. Buffett Foundation did not reply to Fox News request for comment. Buffett published a book in April 2018, titled ""Our 50-State Border Crisis: How the Mexican Border Fuels the Drug Epidemic Across America, suggesting his own idea of what needs to be done at the border to boost security. He believes that the best solution is a combination of properly equipped law enforcement, some barriers in places and cooperation with Mexico and other countries.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy Billionaire Warren Buffett has been spilling some secrets about his unique lifestyle in recent days, and his revelations have not disappointed. This week, the 88-year-old CEO of Berkshire Hathaway opened up his wallet  literally  to reveal what he carries on him at all times. In an interview with Yahoo! Finance Wednesday, Buffett said he always makes sure he has these two things on him: hundreds in cash and an American Express card. I probably carry, maybe, $400, Buffett explained, adding that his spouse, 73-year-old Astrid Menks, prefers to use cash over credit. When it comes to spending, the businessman, who is ranked No. 3 in Forbes' billionaires' list with an $89.2 billion net worth, said old habits die hard. ""I've got an American Express card which I got in 1964, he joked with Yahoo! Finance. But I pay cash 98 percent of the time. If I'm in a restaurant, I always pay cash. It's just easier. He may be one of the world's richest people but Buffett has frequently been called ""frugal."" ""I pay cash 98 percent of the time. If I'm in a restaurant, I always pay cash. It's just easier. The billionaire has been living in the same house (which he originally bought for $31,000) for more than 60 years, drives an average car and never spends more than $3 or $4 on his daily McDonald's breakfast. ""The truth is, I only drive about 3,500 miles a year so I will buy a new car very infrequently,"" he told Forbes in 2014. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX BUSINESS APP Last week, Buffett confirmed he still has an unhealthy diet  crushing five cans of Coca-Cola a day, frequently scanning fast-food menus and topping it all off with a sweet Dairy Queen sundae. Im not bothered by the thought of my death, Buffett recently told the Financial Times, adding that he loves UTZ potato sticks. However, he emphasized that his diet doesn't slow him down and he's still very much active when it comes to managing his company. Im one-quarter Coca-Cola, Buffett told Fortune in 2015. If I eat 2,700 calories a day  a quarter of that is Coca-Cola. I drink at least five 12-ounce servings. I do it every day.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates briefly ditched software for soft-serve while recently attending Berkshire Hathaways annual meeting with Warren Buffett. The billionaires took a lunch break at a nearby Dairy Queen  which Buffett's company acquired in 1998  in April. The pair donned aprons while participating in a standard employee training. ""We learned how to work the cash register, greet guests, and make a Blizzard (including the proper way to serve it, 'Always upside down with a smile!'),"" Gates, 63, explained in a blog post last week. ""I think I may have been a quicker study than Warren in the Blizzard department but ... you can judge for yourself."" A nearly 4-minute video posted on Gates' blog showed the businessmen getting ready to work. ""This is just a sample of our competence. If you think this is bad, wait until we really get into action,"" joked Buffett, 88, after the two accidentally put on the wrong name tags. The competition to serve the best blizzard  and cone in general  was a rocky road. ""Who had the bad luck to draw me?"" asked Buffett as he handed a customer a small vanilla cone, drawing laughs. ""If you want anything, later on, it's on me."" A Dairy Queen employee stood beside the pair as they worked the cash register. ""A double banana split? You're a real man,"" Buffett repeated a male customer's order. Buffett offered to put his hand out to collect customers' money, joking that he'd leave Gates to do the ""high-tech stuff.""

FAQ - New Privacy Policy Warren Buffett, the 88-year-old billionaire investor, thinks Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is the best fit for the job, despite some criticism from the White House. There is nobody better than Jay Powell to be running the Fed, Buffett told FOX Business Liz Claman on Saturday during the annual Berkshire Hathaway shareholder meeting. President Trump has frequently criticized the Fed and Powell for what he perceives as hindering economic growth. In 2018, the Fed voted to raise the benchmark federal funds rate four times, much to the ire of Trump. However, in 2019, its favored a wait-and-see approach, leaving interest rates unchanged. Ahead of the FOMCs two-day meeting this week, Trump called on policymakers to lower interest rates by 1 percent. However, citing muted inflation, the Fed voted to keep interest rates steady. Our Federal Reserve has incessantly lifted interest rates, even though inflation is very low, and instituted a very big dose of quantitative tightening. We have the potential to go up like a rocket if we did some lowering of rates, like one point, and some quantitative easing, Trump wrote in a series of tweets. Buffett said he understood Trumps desire to influence monetary policy set by the Fed. Presidents have always wanted that, he said. Particularly with election years coming up. So thats not unusual. He conceded, however, that the proper relation between the Fed and the White House is one in which the central bank remains independent.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy Cryptocurrency entrepreneur Justin Sun apologized on Thursday for over-marketing and postponing his charity lunch with Warren Buffett, putting into question whether the expected meet-up would actually occur. The Chinese digital currency investor wrote in a post on Weibo  a microblogging site equivalent to Twitter in China  that he bid on a lunch with the Berkshire Hathaway CEO because he admired Buffetts philanthropic commitments and wanted to advocate for the blockchain industry. ""I cannot deny that I want to promote blockchain-related business at the same time. However, because of my immature words, behavior, youth, and vigor, I spoke without thinking twice,"" Sun wrote in his post that appeared on Weibo just before 3 a.m. Beijing time Thursday. ""It became a failing of over-marketing that was out of my control. It also generated a much-unexpected outcome on me."" Sun was scheduled to meet with Buffett on Thursday in San Francisco after the 29-year-old, during a charity auction in June, placed a record-breaking bid of $4,567,888 to have a private lunch with Buffett. The lunch would have been interesting given that the billionaire has repeatedly slammed cryptocurrency, even saying bitcoin has no unique value at all in a February interview with CNBCs Squawk Box. It attracts charlatans, Buffett said. If you do something phony by going out and selling yo-yos or something, theres no money in it  but when you get into Wall Street, theres huge money. Luckily for Sun, Buffett did tell CNBC that blockchain has potential. The Chinese entrepreneur said in a previous news release that he was looking forward to talking to Buffett about it. By Monday, however, Suns TRON Foundation posted a tweet saying the lunch was postponed because Sun was suffering from kidney stones. The foundation said both Buffett and Sun agreed to reschedule the lunch  but the postponement caused others to speculate whether the 29-year-old was in trouble with Chinese authorities. It's unclear when Justin Sun will have his lunch with Warren Buffett. Some believed Sun was barred from leaving China and possibly under house arrest. Chinese media reports added fuel to the rumors after claiming Suns companies were being investigated for illegal fundraising and money laundering, The Wall Street Journal reported. On Tuesday, Sun shot down rumors by going live on Periscope for about 9 minutes to show he was in San Francisco, Calif., and not in China. He told followers who tuned in that he was feeling better before panning the camera to the view of the Bay Bridge from a room. He reassured viewers that his lunch with Buffett will be rescheduled. Sun later tweeted, I feel so much better now! It seems I will be back to work with full speed on this Friday! Sun wrote in his Weibo post on Thursday that his self-promotion spiraled out of control and negatively impacted the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry. He apologized to regulators for the concern he caused. ""For the elders, leaders and regulators who care about me, I would like to express my sincere apologies to my premature marketing and words and deeds! I am deeply afraid of the adverse effects caused! I am young, not deeply involved in the world, and the blockchain belongs to the emerging industry, he wrote in a Weibo post. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX BUSINESS APP He added that he will rest to recover from his illness and post less on social media. In everything I do, I will discard my own selfishness, and put the interest of the country, the industry and the public first, Sun wrote. Its still unclear if and when the charity lunch will occur.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Aren't establishment leaders like Warren the reason many Dems are walking away from the party? #WalkAway campaign founder Brandon Straka reacts. Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren has apologized to the Cherokee Nation for taking a DNA test to prove she had Native-American ancestry, taking a step to smooth over the lingering controversy as she prepares to formally launch her 2020 presidential campaign. Senator Warren has reached out to us and has apologized to the tribe. We are encouraged by this dialogue and understanding that being a Cherokee Nation tribal citizen is rooted in centuries of culture and laws, not through DNA tests, Cherokee Nation spokeswoman Julie Hubbard said in a statement. BOOKER JUMPS INTO 2020 RACE The October DNA test by the Massachusetts senator angered some tribal leaders and sparked plenty of political pushback against the senator at the time. The New York Times and The Intercept first reported the apology, a break from Warren's past reluctance to issue one. But the Times reported Warren privately expressed concern she may have hurt her standing with Native-American groups and her own supporters in her handling of the test. We are encouraged by her action and hope that the slurs and mockery of tribal citizens and Indian history and heritage will now come to an end, Hubbard added. The move comes just over a week before Warren is expected to formally declare her candidacy for president, after having launched an exploratory committee. On Thursday, her campaign teased that Warren would have an announcement on Feb. 9. Warren's effort to clean up from the DNA test rollout comes as several other big-name figures enter the 2020 race -- most recently, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker on Friday. Warren, who was born and grew up in Oklahoma, had for decades claimed to have Native American heritage. But it wasnt until her successful 2012 campaign for the U.S. Senate in Massachusetts that she revealed she had claimed minority status at universities where she worked. The controversy became an issue in her race against Republican incumbent Scott Brown. WARREN RELEASES DNA ANALYSIS Warren rolled out her DNA results just weeks before the 2018 midterm elections. She was criticized for even conducting the test and was accused of succumbing to attacks from President Trump  who has repeatedly called her ""Pocahontas"" in his campaign-style rallies and on social media. The DNA results also fueled claims by Republican critics that she used a trace amount of Native American heritage to advance her academic career. The test itself revealed strong evidence the Massachusetts senator had a Native-American ancestor dating back six to 10 generations. But that means if Warrens great-great-great-grandmother were Native American, she would be considered 1/64 Native American. Should Warrens ancestor date back 10 generations, she would be only 1/1,024 Native American. The Cherokee Nation slammed Warren at the time, with the tribes secretary of state Chuck Hoskin Jr., saying the use of a DNA test to lay claim to any connection to the Cherokee Nation or any tribal nation, even vaguely, is inappropriate and wrong. Warrens apology appears to be an about-face by the senator, who up until now had repeatedly defended taking the DNA test. Asked about it on the campaign trail in Iowa  days after she launched a presidential exploratory committee on Dec. 31  Warren said she acted in the interest of transparency. My decision was Im just going to put it all out there. All my hiring records. Including the DNA test. Its out there. Its online. Anybody can look at it, she explained.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy Though Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has been outspoken about taxing the wealthy, one of the 2020 frontrunners certainly has plenty of money herself. When the 70-year-old presidential hopeful filed personal financial disclosures for her candidacy back in February, the forms showed approximations for her retirement accounts and book royalties. The forms, which were tweeted at the time, also showed that she got a $300,000 book advance for her book This Fight Is Our Fight, which was released in April 2017, and that she holds the title of Emeritus Professor at Harvard University. Warren later released her 2018 tax returns in April, along with her returns from every year as far back as 2008. Her 2018 returns revealed that she and her husband Bruce Mann paid more than $200,000 in taxes on a joint income of about $900,000 last year. Warren also reported about $325,000 for the books shes written, and an income of $176,280 for her job as a senator. Mann meanwhile reported an income of about $400,000 from his job as a law professor at Harvard. The couple also donated more than $50,000 to charity. Overall, Warren is worth approximately $12 million, according to a recent estimate from Forbes. The outlet reported that most of her and her husbands assets are held in retirement accounts (approximately $4 million) as well as real estate. Warren and her husband reportedly have a $3 million home in Cambridge, Mass., and an $800,000 condo in Washington, D.C. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS Back in January, Warren released a plan to tax the ultra-wealthy, which could cost some of the richest people in America billions of dollars in net worth over decades, according to a recent paper. However, the tax -- which would impose a 2 percent tax on individuals with a net worth above $50 million, and a 3 percent tax on those with more than $1 billion in assets -- wouldnt reach her own wealth, since she has less than $1 billion.

In the 1960s, Warren Buffett made what he would later call ""a monumentally stupid decision."" However, it was also the foundation of the rest of his career. Buffett, now 89, known as the ""Oracle of Omaha,"" is the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway. He is considered one of the most successful investors of all time and is estimated to be worth $72 billion, according to Forbes. But in 1962, Berkshire Hathaway was a failing textile company with cheap stock and Buffett was running a small investing entity called Buffett Partnership Ltd. In 2010, Buffett told CNBC that Berkshire Hathaway was ""the dumbest stock I ever bought."" BUFFETT'S BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY REPORTS NEARLY $50B LOSS AS INVESTMENTS DROP ""It was a huge company originally, and they kept closing one mill after another,"" Buffett told the business channel. ""And every time they would close a mill, they would  take the proceeds and they would buy in their stock. And I figured they were gonna close, they only had a few mills left, but that they would close another one. I'd buy the stock. I'd tender it to them and make a small profit."" Berkshire Hathaway Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett is pictured in 2017. (AP Photo/Nati Harnik) By 1964, Buffett had about 7 percent of the company's shares. He went to Seabury Stanton, who ran Berkshire Hathaway at the time, and told him that he would sell his stock back for $11.50. But when Buffett received a letter from Stanton on May 6, 1964, the company was asking for $11.375 per share instead. HOW JP MORGAN'S JAMIE DIMON WENT FROM BEING FIRED TO BECOMING A TOP LEADER IN BANKING ""Irritated by Stanton's chiseling, I ignored his offer and began to aggressively buy more Berkshire shares,"" Buffett wrote in a 2014 letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders. He wrote that it was ""a monumentally stupid decision."" By early May 1965, Buffett Partnership took over the company, according to the letter. ""Though Seabury's and my childish behavior -- after all, what was an eighth of a point to either of us? -- he lost his job, and I found myself with more than 25 percent of BPL's capital invested in a terrible business about which I knew very little,"" Buffett wrote. BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY ANNUAL MEETING 2020: 5 THINGS TO KNOW In 1967, Berkshire Hathaway bought an insurance company but continued to work in textiles as well, despite the fact that it ""was earning nothing, year after year after year after year,"" he told CNBC. In fact, Buffett kept the textile assets running for the next twenty years, despite the losses, all the while continuing to acquire companies in other industries under the Berkshire Hathaway umbrella. Buffet is pictured in 2017. (Photo by Paul Morigi/WireImage) However, he told CNBC that the first insurance company Berkshire acquired should actually have been bought ""for a new entity."" GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE ""[If] instead of putting that money into the textile business originally, we just started out with the insurance company, Berkshire would be worth twice as much as it is now,"" he told the channel. Ultimately, Buffett said the lesson he learned in the process was: ""If you get in a lousy business, get out of it."" ""I've always said that if you want to be known as a good manager, buy a good business,"" he added. ""That's the way to do it. And everyone will think you're smart.""

Today, the conglomerate owns more than 90 companies including GEICO, Dairy Queen, Fruit of the Loom and Duracell and has major investments in companies including Apple, American Express, Coca-Cola and Bank of America. Berkshire Hathaway is also sitting on a pile of more than $137 billion in cash because Buffett has struggled to find major acquisitions for the company recently.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy Warren Buffetts Woodstock for Capitalists was effectively canceled this year, dealing a huge blow to Omahas economy. Each year, Berkshire Hathaway Inc.s annual meeting brings tens of thousands of attendees to Nebraskas largest city. These Berkshire acolytes flood local hotels and restaurants, and Berkshire businesses sell their wares at the convention center. But this year, shareholders are banned from attending in a bid to limit the spread of the novel coronavirus, and Mr. Buffett will speak via a live-streamed video instead. It is a significant loss for Omaha businesses. The economic impact of the meeting alone is $21.3 million, according to Visit Omaha, the citys tourism bureau. It is also not the only cancellation to hit Omaha. The annual College World Series, slated for June, has been postponed until 2021, as has the U.S. Olympic swim trials. Visit Omaha estimates that event cancellations from March 1 to June 30 will cost the citys economy $197 million. WARREN BUFFETT AXES 'WOODSTOCK' FESTIVITIES AT BERKSHIRE'S ANNUAL MEETING Its been a cascade of bad news, says Dennis Pate, executive director and chief executive officer of Omahas Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium, which often hosts private parties over the weekend for Berkshire senior executives and board members, including Mr. Buffett. Mr. Pate expects the zoo to lose roughly $25,000 from event cancellations during that weekend. Omaha isnt alone. San Diego has canceled this years Comic-Con International convention; Boston has postponed its annual marathon to September. Cities across the world have been forced to cancel or postpone their marquee events due to the pandemic, each with its own unique and staggering economic toll. Aerial Drone Photography Downtown Omaha Nebraska The CHI Health Center Omaha, operated by the Metropolitan Entertainment & Convention Authority, hosts the annual event in its massive arena and adjoining exhibit hall. A MECA representative says the loss of the Berkshire meeting will cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. Hotels and short-term rentals around the city have seen a wave of cancellations. In 2019, hotel revenue in Omaha for the Berkshire weekend alone totaled $6.7 million, according to data company STR. Kellie Rice, who rents out rooms in her house through Airbnb Inc., typically charges about $45 to $55 a night. During last years annual meeting, Ms. Rice charged around $200 a night. IN CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC, WARREN BUFFETT SELLS SOME DELTA, SOUTHWEST AIRLINES STOCK Some people on Airbnb were getting $600 to over $1,000 a night, Ms. Rice says. I thought there was no way people would pay that. I wasnt going to make that mistake again this year. Instead, her bookings for the next several months have all but disappeared. Ms. Rice also drives for ride-hailing services Uber Technologies Inc. and Lyft Inc. During the annual meeting she spends hours driving shareholders between the convention center, restaurants, and Mr. Buffetts home. At Gorats, a favorite of Mr. Buffett, manager Gene Dunn says the steakhouse typically sees 3,000 patrons over the course of a Berkshire weekend. In all, the event usually brings in over $150,000. Warren Buffett, chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, right, and his Vice-Chairman Charlie Munger, are projected on large screens as they preside over a question and answer session during the annual shareholders meeting in Omaha, Neb., Saturday, Ma Its our four biggest days of the year, Mr. Dunn says. Elizabeth Wallace, general manager at 801 Chophouse, said that there are three dates you must be available to work if you want to be hired by the steakhouse: New Years Eve, Valentines Day, and the Berkshire meeting. This is your moneymaking weekend, she says, recalling her own days as a bartender and a server. Ill be able to pay my mortgage for a couple of months after working three days. WARREN BUFFETT'S DAUGHTER EXPOSED TO CORONAVIRUS Even if the event wasnt canceled this year, attendees looking for a reservation would be out of luck. Both restaurants shut their doors in mid-March due to the pandemic, and on March 20 Douglas County mandated that restaurants close their dining rooms. Aside from restaurants, there is also money that wont be made at the CHI Health Center where several Omaha-based businesses typically join the dozens of Berkshire-owned companies in the exhibit hall. Borsheims, a local jewelry store that has been a unit of Berkshire since 1989, usually takes a spot in the exhibit hall and hosts special events at its store on Friday and Sunday. Chief Executive Karen Goracke says the store has more than 20,000 visitors over those two days. The store, which offers discounts to shareholders during the weekend, has been sending out guides to its vendors collections and offering its discount online instead. It wont be the same opportunity to connect, but hopefully we can replace some of that feeling, Ms. Goracke says. One local business owner who will miss out on the exposure that a Berkshire meeting brings is Phillip Black, co-owner of the family-owned bookstore The Bookworm. Mr. Black, who typically runs a booth at the convention center, says he will miss the excitement of selling at the annual meeting. He recalls that in 2005, The Bookworm sold about 3,500 copies of Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Mungers newly-released Poor Charlies Almanack during the weekend. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS Mr. Black says he and his wife, co-owner Beth Black, had been working up this years book list with Mr. Buffett just before the annual meeting was canceled. The bookstore will still be selling the titles and offering its special shareholder discount online. Total sales at the event typically exceed $100,000, Mr. Black says, which is comparable to what the bookstore sells in a month during slower parts of the year. This year will be different. The bookstore has received a Paycheck Protection Program loan that allows them to keep their staff filling telephone and web orders as foot traffic dies down. That will see us through April and May, and we just hope that everything revives, he says. In a business like this, you have to be optimistic.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy Legendary investor Warren Buffetts Berkshire Hathaway made a number of changes to its portfolio at the end of 2019, including adjustments to its five largest stakes. The value of the Omaha, Nebraska-based companys stock holdings increased by 12.6 percent, or $26 billion, to $231.6 billion in the three months through December, outperforming the S&P 500s 8.5 percent gain. While Buffett and his team added four new positions to their portfolio, they sold shares in some of their biggest investments. Berkshire trimmed its most substantial stake, in Apple, by 1 percent to 245 million shares, which were valued at $71.99 billion at the time of publication. The conglomerate also sold shares in Bank of America and Wells Fargo, its second- and fifth-largest holdings. At the end of the fourth quarter, Berkshire owned 925 million shares of Charlotte, N.C.-based Bank of America, down 0.2 percent from the prior three months. Its stake in San Francisco-based Wells Fargo was slashed by 15 percent, or 55 million shares, to 323 million shares. Berkshires remaining Bank of America and Wells Fargo holdings were worth $32.6 billion and $17.4 billion, respectively. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS Coca-Cola and American Express were Berkshires third- and fourth-largest holdings at the end of the fourth quarter, worth a respective $22.14 billion and $18.87 billion. While Berkshire owns a number of businesses outright, including Burlington Northern railroad, Dairy Queen and aerospace manufacturer Precision Castparts, the conglomerate more often finds value ""in publicly-traded businesses, in which we normally acquire a 5% to 10% interest,"" Buffett wrote in an annual letter to investors in 2019. ""In recent years, the sensible course for us to follow has been clear: Many stocks have offered far more for our money than we could obtain by purchasing businesses in their entirety."" It was because of that disparity that Berkshire purchased $43 billion of marketable stocks in 2018 alone.

Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech announced a promising COVID-19 vaccine candidate last week, while Moderna did the same on Monday. MODERNA'S COVID-19 VACCINE: WHAT TO KNOW Buffett had increasingly faced pressure this year to use his nearly $150 billion cash pile to purchase significant stakes in companies or possibly to buy an entire business. While he has increased stakes in gold and other investments, Buffett did guide Berkshire's purchase of Dominion Energy Inc.'s midstream energy business in May. Then just two months ago, Berkshire Hathaway revealed a near $7 billion investment in five of Japan's biggest general trading companies with operations in everything from mining to real estate to food and logistics.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy Warren Buffett is the fourth-richest man in the world and you don't rise to that level without a few savvy moves. With an estimated personal net worth of $90 billion, per Forbes, the down-to-earth investor has built his portfolio with household names and proven earners. His Berkshire Hathaway was worth $231.6 billion as of this year. Among his biggest holdings: Apple, Coca-Cola, Bank of America, American Express and Wells Fargo. Earlier this month he assumed a new position in Kroger and has been steadily building positions in airlines, including Southwest and banks such as JPMorgan. BUFFETT'S 5 BIGGEST STOCK HOLDINGS While he doesn't divulge the precise way he and his team select investments, he has discussed over the years some of his top criteria which include two key characteristics, one of which is a moat. Many average folks may think of a moat from the perspective of a king or a queen in a castle. A moat surrounds the castle and acts as a protector. A moat in the corporate world functions in a similar way. It means your business is likely the very best in its field and set far apart from weaker competitors and untouchable from a competitive stance. ""In business, I look for economic castles protected by unbreachable 'moats.'"" ""In business, I look for economic castles protected by unbreachable 'moats,'"" said Buffett in his 1995 letter to shareholders. At the time, he gave a shoutout to his insurance company GEICO for being that moat. BUFFETT BAILS ON NEWSPAPERS At the time, GEICO boasted 3.7 million auto insurance customers. Today, that figure has risen to more than 17 million, according to the company. The Geico van at the Houston Air Show. The air show was held at the Ellington International Airport. Fast-forward, Buffett's Berkshire has been on the hunt for a company that can mirror the success of a GEICO and is ""elephant-sized."" CLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS In last year's annual shareholder letter, Buffett expressed his desire to put his massive pile of cash to work, $128 billion as of last check, but he bemoaned that prices were a bit lofty at the time. WARREN BUFFETT TOOK A PASS ON TIFFANY'S ""In the years ahead, we hope to move much of our excess liquidity into businesses that Berkshire will permanently own. The immediate prospects for that, however, are not good: Prices are sky-high for businesses possessing decent long-term prospects. That disappointing reality means that 2019 will likely see us again expanding our holdings of marketable equities,"" he said while also noting that he will continue his hunt. ""We continue, nevertheless, to hope for an elephant-sized acquisition. Even at our ages of 88 and 95  Im the young one  that prospect is what causes my heart and Charlies to beat faster. (Just writing about the possibility of a huge purchase has caused my pulse rate to soar.)"" ""We continue, nevertheless, to hope for an elephant-sized acquisition. Even at our ages of 88 and 95  Im the young one  that prospect is what causes my heart and Charlies to beat faster. (Just writing about the possibility of a huge purchase has caused my pulse rate to soar.),"" he said. Buffett also noted of the cash pile he sets aside a cool $20 billion ""to guard against external calamities."" Even still that leaves an estimated $100 billion-plus to make some deals.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy January 1 does not just mark a new year, it also marks a new decade. To put that into context, look back at the last decade as 2009 rolled into 2010. The Dow Jones Industrial closed 10,428.05 on Dec. 31, 2009. On Tuesday it closed at 28,538.44. The NASDAQ at the end of the last decade closed at 2269.15. The tech-heavy exchange ended the year at 8,972.60 Ten years ago at this time, there were no iPads under any Christmas trees, it didn't debut until January of 2010. Multi-use rockets to space were science fiction until November of 2015 thanks to Blue Origin and SpaceX, which have re-ignited the space race. Then, there are things that are no longer with us. In 2013, the days of trips to Blockbuster ended as the last of the retail stores were shut down (though one store remains). Pontiac once ruled the roads, but in 2010 General Motors put the brakes on the brand with franchise agreements for dealers expiring on Halloween -- it was no trick or treat. So what's ahead for 2020? We asked some of Fox Business Network anchors and correspondents to weigh in with picks, predictions or prognostications for 2020. From left to right: Kristina Partsinevelos, Neil Cavuto, Cheryl Casone, Liz Claman, Ashley Webster and Jackie DeAngelis Looking ahead to 2020 I think there are three things to really watch for: First, its obviously an election year and as we get more into the rhetoric about taxes and the economy, I think were going to have to really start to dig deep down and analyze what these candidates have to say. The big thing will be of course the result of that election in November. Wall Street will be watching. I think President Trump wins based on the economy. Cheryl Casone: Wall Street will keep a close watch on President Trump's re-election bid STOCK MARKET ACTION AFTER 2020 ELECTION SWEEP MIGHT SURPRISE YOU Second, theres been so much talk about a recession in 2020, especially in the first quarter. I do not see that happening. My prediction is the market and the economy will continue to be strong. Of course, it is always nice to see a small pullback and maybe we will get that at some point in the year but I just dont see it happening in January or February. Third, Ill be keeping an eye on the jobs picture. Its been great to see unemployment at a 50-year low, but my prediction for 2020 is that were finally going to see wages meaningfully head higher. Companies are doing better and they will start to pay their employees better in 2020. THE 10 BIGGEST BUSINESS STORIES IN 2019 Impeachment remains likely to be a major news event in the new year, but that doesnt mean it will be a business news event to watch in the new year. For all the hype and polarizing attention, markets have ignored this long and sorted political saga. Investors are taking it as a given the Presidents impeachment goes no further than the House of Representatives, with a quick, and likely unceremonious end, in the Senate. Thats why its not on Wall Streets radar. Here are some of the things that will be: If 2019 ended as the year of the trade tease, 2020 will be the year we discover whether the tease lived up to the hype. By then, we should not only know the details of trade agreements but whether the countries with whom weve agreed to them, will honor them. Remember, there are two big accords were talking about: the one with China, and the other with Mexico and Canada. Neither are slam-dunks. The Mexicans are still protesting U.S. labor inspectors in their country monitoring compliance. And the Chinese have yet to spell out when and how many agricultural goods theyll buy from the U.S., and during what time period. That means, despite the hype, no one has yet to sign off on the details that remain alarmingly vague. Neil Cavuto: Will trade agreement like the USMCA live up to the hype? (iStock) Forget the heated political election year, when it comes to bashing technology, expect both parties to be preaching (and railing) from the same choir sheet. Democrats and Republicans are oddly united on bringing the tech giants down a peg or two. Democrats argue these companies have simply become too big for their britches and should be broken up. Republicans, led by President Trump, say their content is so skewed and biased, that they need to be fundamentally realigned. That likely means some de-fanging for the FANG stocks (and some non-FANG stocks as well), including Facebook, Amazon, Google, and possibly Apple. What better time to make a political-bashing statement than slap-dab in the middle of a presidential election year? Watch this one closely. Theres a reason why big tech should feel like General Custer. They really ARE surrounded! Housing will get hotter in 2020. I didnt say hot, just hotter. And the difference will be younger, namely millennial buyers coming in, helping to reestablish a domino of events that could lift the entire real estate sector. The sudden surge in younger buyer interest has picked up considerable steam in just the last few months. If it holds, and I suspect it will, it stands to reverse the sluggish dynamic that has been holding housing back  hurt at the lower end by a lack of buyers and a general lack of interest. Assuming interest rates remain low, and job growth remains strong and the millennial foot traffic picks up, expect all this to feed on itself and up the housing food chain  particularly along the coasts. But not just the coasts  Cities including Nashville, Tenn., and Rochester, N.Y., have been marked as undervalued buys. They are among some of the more price-friendly and tax-friendly locales that stand to see the most buyer interest. That doesnt mean booming interest, but most in the real estate world would more than happily accept more interest. CLICK HERE TO GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO Watch what Warren does in 2020! Within 45 days of the end of every quarter, market big-wigs have to file whats called a 13F form. (Big Wig is defined as hedge fund managers and CEOs like Berkshire Hathaways Warren Buffett who have the power to cause gyrations in the market if the world knows what theyre buying and selling on a day-to-day basis). The form requires disclosure of the name of the stock, the class of the security, and the number of shares said manager bought during the quarter. As of this writing, were still tacking on to the longest bull market in history. The Oracle of Omaha is frugal! He likes to dive in when others are fleeing because during sell-offs, stocks are cheaper and valuations become more palatable. So absent of a correction or drop in the market, finding out what hes buying now is like having the professor do your homework for you. He and his two stock-pickers, Todd Combs and Ted Wechsler, only buy what they feel matches the Buffett metrics. Prediction: BOTH the Russians *and* the Chinese will be busted for trying to hack, meddle and/or affect the 2020 presidential election. If the cybersecurity company that discovers it is publicly traded, expect its shares to spike. Concern: North Korea. Kim Jong Un is so unstable, and one could argue is like a wounded animal backed into a corner, that he could do something crazy like a test or actually launch a missile that gets too close to Japan or the U.S. territory of Guam where 6,000 service people are stationed. That could have a black swan effect on the markets and trigger a sharp sell-off. Three things to watch next year that will impact the market: The Fed: After three cuts in 2019, the Fed is on pause. But the president isnt satisfied with rates where they are. He just tweeted that he thinks the dollar is too strong and more cuts are needed. What will Jerome Powell do? The stock market seems to be satisfied with a pause, further cuts would be likely to boost the market. JPs in an interesting spot. China: The market was happy to receive the gift of a phase one deal before Christmas, but how does the China trade story play out next year? Theres still more work to be done and the parties have said theyll start working on phase two immediately. China headlines are powerful and they moved markets this year. The China story isnt over; its just getting started. The Election: The economy has been Trump's greatest accomplishment, so the economy will impact the election and the election will impact the economy. Love him or hate him, the people Ive spoken to on Wall Street say they want him to win, they do not want to deal with the policies of Warren, Sanders or even Biden, which would involve higher taxes and spending. Concern: Despite the continuous stock market record highs, many traders are approaching the beginning of 2020 with caution. Options traders are buying contracts that would make them money if the S&P 500 drops in the next few months. The CBOE Skew Index, much like the VIX, measures the expectation of unusual or black swan market events. That index hit a high we havent seen since September 2018, showing investor sentiment remains restrained despite the strong economy and buoyant stock market. NASDAQ'S 1,000 POINT MARCH TO 9,000 TOOK A BIT LONGER THAN USUAL Trend: Sustainable efforts will continue to have a huge impact across all industries heading into 2020. Whether it be sustainable shoes like Reeboks first plant-based running shoe. (Im just waiting for someone to make a video and attempt to cook and eat the shoe) or sustainable farming. With the hype around Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods, the past year has shown consumers want to know the way we produce food, or how we produce food. The trend is even prevalent within the agriculture sector. I met several farmers at a conference in Omaha, Neb., who increased their efforts to ensure their farming practices are as beneficial for the earth as it for our tables. Kristina Partsinevelos: Sustainable efforts will continue to have a huge impact across all industries (Beyond Meat) BEYOND MEAT CRAZE, DEMAND FOR PLANT-BASED FOODS BOOSTS MEATLESS JOB MARKET Concern: I have started to refer to China's control around the globe as modern-day colonialism and I worry we arent paying enough attention to the China is wielding. Data from the most recent Financial Times research revealed nearly two-thirds of the worlds top 50 companies had some degree of Chinese investment by 2015, up from one-fifth in 2010. Chinese schools are popping up in greater numbers in places like Australia and Africa; Rwanda boasts an entire Chinese speaking brigade. China continues to expand its infrastructure using its Belt and Road Initiative with investments spanning 152 countries. Its, as my friend and frequent Fox Business contributor John Layfield would say, a systematic slow creep. Just this year, China launched a subsidiary of the global financial messaging service platform SWIFT in response to the growing demand for the Yuan. China is moving towards becoming the sole superpower, without the need for battle and the U.S. could be left behind. The Bull Market Lives On: This time last year the markets began to tank on fears of a slowing global economy, a U.S. economy that surely must start to slow down, a feisty trade war with China and economic data that had so-called experts proudly proclaiming a looming recession for America. They were wrong. DOW GAINS 10,000TH POINT SINCE TRUMP'S ELECTION The most hated bull market in history began in March of 2009 and has taken markets relentlessly higher. Its the best performing bull market since World War II. In fact, remarkably, the S&P 500 has gained more than 470-percent during that time. I believe this will continue in 2020. The U.S. economy remains solid, a trade deal with China will continue in phases and Wall Street believes the Democrats socialist agenda will put Donald Trumps market-friendly administration back in the White House for another four years. There is still plenty of cash still sitting on the sidelines that will provide more fuel to push stocks higher. As Europe continues to struggle, investors desperate for any type of yield will turn to this side of the Atlantic. That goes for much of the global investment community. Throw in an accommodative, passive Federal Reserve and this Bull Run will have plenty of legs in 2020. Enjoy the ride and see your retirement accounts grow. A 5G World: Like everyone else, Im intrigued and expectant to see what a 5G world looks and feels like. Well find out in 2020. Im far from a tech expert but I know that 5G stands for fifth-generation cellular wireless. According to the hype, 5G will provide greater download speeds, up to five to ten times faster than 4G LTE. We can also expect much-improved video streaming and the ability to connect more devices to the network. It will also have big implications for other products that rely on network connections, everything from virtual reality to autonomous vehicles. In short, 2019 will be known as the network stone age. For investors, 5G will offer some interesting investment choices. Most analysts believe companies with the most exposure and potential for growth include Verizon Communications, Cisco Systems and Nokia. Apple is expected to roll out its 5G iPhones in the fall of 2020. That could trigger the first significant upgrade cycle in years, despite the eye-watering rumored price of $1,250. But consumers may also benefit from a price war between AT&T, Sprint and T-Mobile. Whether youre excited or not get ready for some major buzz over 5G in 2020. Tech stocks: Every day on Varney & Company we track the movements of the big tech stocks, and with good reason. According to Goldman Sachs, Big tech has been the very backbone of the bull market. In fact, Apple alone has contributed 20 percentage points of the S&P 500 total return. Microsoft has added 17 percent and Amazon 9 percent. Analysts say its worrying that just a handful of stocks are carrying so much of the upward impetus but its impossible to ignore the size and power of these companies and difficult to bet against them. Ill be expecting these same tech behemoths to post impressive gains but there is a caveat. Until regulations hurt the business models of these companies it appears negative news, such as data breaches, do little to hurt the stock price. But I think regulation  comprehensive regulation  is on the horizon. Europe has already thrown down the gauntlet with its General Data Protection Regulation or GDPR. Its designed to improve the data protection rights of users and clarifies what companies must do to safeguard those rights. GOOGLE TO ACQUIRE WEARABLE-TECH MAKER FITBIT FOR $2.1B The regulations went into effect in May of 2018 and while protecting users it has hurt European business. According to Merrill Corporation, 55 percent of M&A professionals surveyed said they had worked on transactions that failed because of compliance issues with GDPR. Another survey by Bitkom in Germany showed 75 percent believed that data protection requirements are the main obstacle to the development of technologies. I only mention this because, too often, there are unintended consequences to well-intentioned regulations and as U.S. lawmakers set their sights on big tech companies the outcome is far from certain. But until that point, I truly believe big tech will continue to lead the way in 2020!

This week - Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday - his Berkshire Hathaway bought about 34 million common shares, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The buying increased from a little over 9 million shares on Tuesday to over 13 million on Wednesday for a price of about $24 per share. The purchase lifted his stake to slightly over 11 percent, as tracked by Thomson One. During the Berkshire Hathaway meeting in May, which was virtual this year for the first time in history, Buffett did not speak of BofA specifically but did say the banking industry was in good shape to weather the pandemic. ""Theyre well-capitalized for it. They were reserve building in the first quarter, and they may need to build more reserves. But they are not a primary worry of mine at all. We own a lot of banks. Or, we own a lot of bank stocks"" he said according to transcripts.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy Investing genius Warren Buffett took the podium for this weekend's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B) shareholder meeting to share his wisdom for three full hours. This company's annual event is always a goldmine for investors who are willing to learn, and the online video-streaming version we got this time was no exception. Consider, for a moment, the retail industry in 2020: COVID-19 containment efforts are pushing consumers into e-commerce shopping and leaving many traditional bricks-and-mortar store chains struggling to stay afloat. Here's what Buffett had to say about the current state of the retail sector. In Buffett's own words ""Department stores looked good in 1966, but the world has gone against them. And we had a trading stamp business at one time and we stayed longer than anybody else. But the world left trading stamps behind and that's going to happen with some businesses. That's capitalism. And it will happen to some Berkshire businesses over the next 10 years, in the next 50 years. We think we'll find more of them that will grow and that Berkshire will grow, but we do not think if you own a great many businesses, that every one is destined for success. That's why I suggest to people that they buy an index fund."" A brief analysis Consumer habits are indeed changing as we speak, and it's becoming more and more difficult to run an old-school retail operation. In the last five years, department store giants Macy's (NYSE:M) and J.C. Penney (NYSE:JCP) have seen their stock fall by 92% and 97%, respectively. TREASURY LAUNCHES 20-YEAR BOND TO HELP FUND RECORD GOVERNMENT BORROWING I call them ""giants"" out of habit. Macy's is barely a mid-cap stock today, and J.C. Penney is a penny stock with one foot in the bankruptcy office. Buffett, of course, has found ways to invest in a few different types of successful retailers in the modern era. Berkshire owns $1.3 billion worth of Costco (NASDAQ:COST) stock and $1.2 billion of Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), giving his company exposure to Costco's membership-based warehouse club model and to Amazon's e-commerce expertise. Many of Berkshire's in-house retail businesses could learn a thing or two from Amazon and Costco, helping Buffett stave off the near-inevitable decay of outdated business plans. 3 SCENARIOS WHERE CLAIMING SOCIAL SECURITY EARLY IS A NO-BRAINER Here's the main point The larger lesson here is that times will change, and the only businesses that will survive for decades and centuries are those that are willing and able to adapt. Berkshire itself is a prime example of this, constantly molding and managing its portfolio of fully owned companies and minority investments to stay relevant in an ever-changing business environment. Buffett's favorite holding period is ""forever,"" but he was also quick to sell off all of Berkshire's interests in the airline industry as the coronavirus pandemic turned that sector upside down. Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) might be best of breed in that sector, but Buffett has no interest in owning the top dogs in a sinking and unpredictable industry. GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE So Buffett backed out of his airline investments and increased his investment in index funds instead. He is also holding on to $137 billion in cash, ready to take action if the coronavirus unveils new investing opportunities by driving the markets down even further. That's another great idea.

CEO Mark Bristow thinks the inaugural investment from Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway is a significant step for his gold mining company and the industry. Berkshire announced a new 20.9 million-share stake in Barrick Gold, worth $564 million. The investment, disclosed late Friday, gives Berkshire a 1.18% stake in Barrick and makes it the 11th largest shareholder. It's the ultimate privilege to have Berkshire Hathaway as an investor in one's company and something that I've been aspiring to, Bristow told FOX Business exclusively. We hope its not the end. News of the investment caused Barrick Gold shares to surge 12% on Monday to their highest level in more than 7 years. The stock has gained 62% this year. Berkshires stake in the Toronto-based Barrick Gold comes despite both Buffett and his right-hand man Charlie Munger over the years repeatedly voicing their disdain for gold. POLLS ARE WRONG, TRUMP WILL BEAT BIDEN: BILLIONAIRE FUND MANAGER GUNDLACH In 2005, Buffett complained gold was something that gets dug out of the ground in Africa and has no utility. Munger once famously said civilized people dont buy gold. Warren Buffett (L), CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, and vice chairman Charlie MungerSource: JOHANNES EISELE/AFP via Getty Images While Buffett's team didn't disclose the reason for its investment, its possible the decision was made by Todd Combs or Ted Weschler, investment managers who are potential successors at Berkshire. Inquires by FOX Business to Buffett were not returned at the time of publication. So what exactly is Berkshire buying? Bristow, who has not spoken to anyone at Berkshire about the investment, said the Omaha-based conglomerate is investing in a miner that has the best people running the best assets and that his company aims to make money in all cycles and doesnt need to pray for the gold price to surge to help it turn a profit. Barrick, in a move that displayed the strength of its business, last week hiked its dividend by 14% to 8 cents per share. The dividend increase came as more than 180 companies have cut their dividends and another 150 have suspended their payouts due to the uncertainty caused by COVID-19. Barricks dividend hike surely put a smile to Buffetts face as he has long expressed his love for stocks with reliable and sustainable payouts, something that Bristow has delivered on throughout his career. Bristows previous company, gold miner Randgold Resources, grew its dividend for 13 years, having never once cut the payout. Randgold merged with Barrick in 2018, creating the worlds second-largest gold miner. The 31% surge in gold prices this year has strengthened the foundation of Barricks business while reducing operating risk, increasing cash flow and bolstering its balance sheet. That has enabled Bristow to fast track his revised dividend policy, which will now be based on some sort of ratio whether it be net income or cash flow, he said. At the end of the second quarter, the Board said it believes the dividend increase is sustainable after reporting ""total liquidity of $6.7 billion, including a cash balance of $3.7 billion.""

FAQ - New Privacy Policy A blistering rally in Tesla Inc.s share price fueled by news the electric-car maker would join the S&P 500 has catapulted its market value into the No. 6 spot among U.S. companies. Teslas market cap reached $555.24 billion on Friday, surpassing that of Warren Buffetts Berkshire Hathaway. The Elon Musk-led Tesla now trails only tech stalwarts Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Amazon Inc., Alphabet Inc. and Facebook Inc. Apple is the most-value U.S. company with a market cap of $1.98 trillion while Facebook is worth $788.8 billion. Tesla has gained $168 billion in market cap since S&P Dow Jones Indices announced Nov. 16 that the automaker would be added to the benchmark S&P 500 on Dec. 21, according to data from the Dow Jones Market Group. The recent gains appear to be the icing on the cake in what is shaping up to be a banner year for Tesla shares, which have gained 600% this year through Friday. The companys market cap is now larger than auto icons Toyota Motor Corp., Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Co. combined. Wall Street analysts have recently ratcheted expectations even higher. Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas raised his price target Nov. 18 to $540 per share, which has already been surpassed, due to the value of Teslas services business. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS Less than a week later, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives raised his target to $560 per share due to growing demand from China and Europe. His bull case scenario calls for shares to reach $1,000 apiece on the belief Tesla could deliver 1 million vehicles as early as 2022. That would give the company a market capitalization of more than $946 billion.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy Berkshire Hathaways annual shareholders meeting is known as Woodstock for capitalists and stands as a unique celebration in the world of business. The meeting drew more than 40,000 attendees last year. But the Warren Buffett-led event isnt any more immune to the coronavirus than anyone else, so this years event will be closed to shareholders for the first time ever. An image of Warren Buffett towers over Berkshire Hathaway shareholders as they visit and shop at company subsidiaries in Omaha, Neb. at the 2017 Berkshire Hathaway shareholders meeting. (AP Photo/Nati Harnik) CORONAVIRUS CANCELED WARREN BUFFETTS SHAREHOLDER PARTY. OMAHA IS SUFFERING Even without the crowds and the Woodstock festivities, the event will go on and Berkshires leadership will take shareholder questions. Here are five things to know before Berkshire Hathaways annual shareholder meeting: Only CEO Warren Buffett and Greg Abel, Berkshires vice chairman of non-insurance operations, will be physically present for the meeting. But the event will be streamed live on Yahoo beginning with a pre-meeting show at 3 p.m. central time. The board will not be physically present, including vice chairman Charlie Munger. But theyll still be able to attend to all the typical business for the meeting. Three journalists have also picked questions from shareholders to ask Buffett and Abel, so the typically-lengthy Q and A session will still go on. Berkshire Hathaway Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett gestures during an interview by Liz Claman of the Fox Business Network in Omaha, Neb. (AP Photo/Nati Harnik, File) WARREN BUFFETT SELLS SOME DELTA, SOUTHWEST AIRLINES STOCK Berkshire sold off sizeable stakes in Delta Air Lines and Southwest Airlines as the coronavirus battered the travel industry, including close to 13 million shares of Delta and about 2.3 million shares of Southwest. Munger also told The Wall Street Journal last month that Berkshire would likely close some of its smaller holdings as a result of the pandemic, but didnt specify which specific businesses would be affected. Berkshire Hathaway Vice Chairman Charlie Munger (REUTERS/Rick Wilking) BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY TO CLOSE SOME BUSINESSES AMID PANDEMIC Bill Gates announced that he was stepping down from Berkshires board of directors earlier this year.

With this years meeting being held virtually, the city is missing out on 21.3 million in economic impact, Dow Jones Newswires reported. Many Berkshire brands offer special promotions for shareholders during the weekend of the event, and theyre still offering the deals even for the remote meeting. Berkshire put up a page on its website with links to all the promotional offers.

Charlie and I have very pragmatic reasons for wanting to assure Berkshires prosperity in the years following our exit: The Mungers have Berkshire holdings that dwarf any of the familys other investments, and I have a full 99 percent of my net worth lodged in Berkshire stock, Buffett wrote. I have never sold any shares and have no plans to do so.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy Elizabeth Warren is bringing the Patagonia jacket back to its humble roots. The Massachusetts senator announced her departure from the 2020 presidential race Thursday while wearing a magenta quilted Patagonia jacket in an emotional press conference outside of her home in Cambridge. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., announced her departure from the 2020 presidential race on Thursday outside her home in Cambridge, Mass.(AP Photo/Steven Senne) Warren, whose campaign aimed to break up big tech companies, is the stark opposite of many who wear the brand's vests to work every day. The Ventura, California-based company has become the unofficial uniform for financiers, bankers and big tech executives like Amazon's Jeff Bezos, a demographic Warren targeted in her proposed wealth tax. And brand experts say that Warren's politics are more in line with what the Certified B Corporation seems to stand for. ELIZABETH WARREN WANTS AMAZON, FACEBOOK, OTHER BIG TECH FIRMS BROKEN UP ""The brand was hijacked and does not represent Wall Street whatsoever. Warren has taken it back to where it's always been,"" marketing strategist Chuck Welch, who has worked with companies like Pepsi and Nike, told FOX Business. ""She's sending signals to her audience by wearing that brand that she's in line with its values."" Patagonia declined to comment. Last year, Patagonia said it would no longer market its clothing to financial firms through its corporate sales program after companies like Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan paid to slap their company logos on its fleeces and outerwear. The vests became so ubiquitous among the fin-tech bro crowd, a parody Instagram account called @MidtownUniform started creating memes of fictional ""Brads"" and ""Chads"" sporting the vests around town. The power vests with bank logos on them started selling for $200 on eBay last year after Patagonia said it would vet its corporate sales program more carefully. ""They've been trying to dissociate themselves from that image,"" Welch said. ""They purposely went away from the Wall Street model because they're a B Corporation that gives them leeway to practice what they preach. They're not tied to quarterly earnings or growth at all costs -- they can think about profits and purpose blending into one thing."" Like Warren, who fought for affordable childcare for all and reproductive rights, Patagonia has long championed work-life balance for its employees and their families. The retailer has had a teacher-run child care program on-site at the companys headquarters for parents for more than three decades so parents can visit their kids while at work. The workplace policy seems to have paid off  100 percent of women who have had kids while working at Patagonia between 2011 and 2016 have returned to work, higher than the 79 percent average in the U.S. Women comprise 50 percent of managers and another 50 percent of senior leaders at the company, Quartz reported. So it's no surprise the senator opted to wear a clothing designer that aligns with her values. Warren has long supported designers that give back to the causes she stands for. Some of her signature bright-colored jackets are made by designer Nina McLemore  who has dressed the likes of Hillary Clinton and Billie Jean King  whose company supports nonprofits that help women, children and education. Patagonia's latest mission-driven cause is a nonpartisan plan to make voting easier in the 2020 election. The company united more than 400 companies across the country including big names like Gap Inc., PayPal and Walmart to make it easy for employees to take time off to vote so they don't have to pick between voting and getting a paycheck. THE 2020 CANDIDATE THAT WALL STREET WANTS TO WIN Theres an adage, the world is run by those who show up, the companys chief executive officer Rose Marcario said in a statement. Only about 60 percent of Americans vote, despite billions of dollars spent trying to get people to the polls. ... No workers should have to choose between earning a paycheck and voting, and it is on all of us as responsible business leaders to contribute to the culture shift needed to increase voter participation in our elections.

Even as the coronavirus pandemic plunges the U.S. economy into the worst downturn since the Great Depression, some of the wealthiest Americans have seen their collective fortunes increase exponentially, according to a new report. U.S. billionaires' wealth has grown by $434 billion since March 18, when the majority of the nation shut down to slow the spread of the virus, findings from Americans for Tax Fairness and the Institute for Policy Studies Program for Inequality show. The report, released Thursday, is based on Forbes data for America's more than 600 billionaires. On March 18, the stock market had already dropped about 29 percent from its Feb. 19 peak. PANDEMIC'S IMPACT ON JOBS MIGHT NOT BE FULLY CAPTURED UNTIL JUNE The five wealthiest Americans  Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Warren Buffett and Larry Elison  saw their combined fortune surge by $75.5 billion, or roughly 19 percent. Together, they represent about 21 percent of the total wealth growth of all 600 billionaires in the last two months. The combined net worths of Bezos, the CEO of Amazon, and Zuckerberg, the CEO of Facebook, grew by nearly $60 billion, or 14 percent of the $434 billion. With millions of Americans stuck at home in an attempt to mitigate the spread of the virus, consumers are increasingly relying on technology for basic needs like groceries. HOUSE DEMOCRATS PROPOSE $2,000 CORONAVIRUS STIMULUS PAYMENT PER MONTH Amazon shares closed around $2,499 on Thursday, which is up nearly 29 percent from the beginning of 2020, when they were around $1,898 per share. Facebook shares were up about 10 percent on Thursday at $231 per share, an increase from $209 at the year's start. Tesla CEO Elon Musk had one of the biggest percentage gains of billionaires; in the course of two months, his net worth surged by 48 percent to $36 billion. Zuckerberg's fortune also increased by one of the biggest percentages, growing by 46.2 percent to $79 billion. The number of billionaires is also increasing: In March, there were 614 billionaires named on the Forbes list; two months later, that number grew to 630. During that same time period, the crisis brought the global economy to a near standstill and pushed 38.6 million Americans onto the unemployment roll in just two months, erasing the entirety of the jobs created since the Great Recession more than a decade ago. WHITE HOUSE EXPLORES $5000 STIMULUS CHECK IN EXCHANGE FOR DELAYED SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS The pandemic has revealed the deadly consequences of Americas yawning wealth gap, and billionaires are the glaring symbol of that economic inequality, said Frank Clemente, ATFs executive director. Not every billionaire has made it out unscathed. Kevin Plank, the founder and chairman of Under Armour, saw his fortune drop by 6.8 percent, or roughly $75 billion, to $1 billion, while Ralph Lauren's fortune fell by $100 billion to $5.6 billion.

Democratic political strategist Mary Anne Marsh told Fox News Tuesday that while former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., are the main competitors for the 1,991 delegates required to win the party's presidential nomination, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., have another strategy. When you look at Bloomberg and Warren, they're hoping to be the consensus candidate at a brokered convention, Marsh told The Daily Briefing. WARREN TAKES AIM AT BIDEN, SAYS 'WASHINGTON INSIDER WILL NOT MEET THIS MOMENT' The goal here is now hoping that Bernie doesnt hit the 1,991 [number] and thats what Elizabeth Warren is playing to right there, she added. Earlier Tuesday, Warren took direct aim at Biden and pitched herself as the compromise candidate between what she characterized as the insider former vice president and the outsider  democratic socialist Sanders. Speaking to supporters in Monterey Park, Calif., Warren characterized Biden -- not Sanders -- as a risk to the Democratic Party and the country. ""I respect his years of service,"" Warren emphasized. ""But no matter how many Washington insiders tell you to support him, nominating their fellow Washington insider will not meet this moment. Nominating a man who says we do not need any fundamental change in this country will not meet this moment, CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP Warren soared in the polls last summer and early in the fall, joining Biden as a co-front-runner in the race.

Like his more famous friend, Warren Buffett, Walter Scott Jr. spent most of his life in his native Omaha, Neb., and made billions from a diverse range of mostly unglamorous businesses. He also dedicated himself to philanthropy and focused much of his giving on his hometown, including major donations to the University of Nebraska Omaha and the Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium. In Nebraska, ""our problem is we cant move any mountains here or any oceans here,"" Mr. Scott told the New York Times in 1998. ""Were stuck on the prairie.

Level 3 was a hot stock in the late 1990s but then floundered amid a glut of long-distance fiber transmission capacity. He was a longtime director of Mr. Buffetts Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and allied himself with the famed Omaha investor to move more deeply into energy utilities. Berkshire Hathaway and Mr. Scott helped lead a 1999 acquisition of MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co.a supplier of electric power and natural gas based in Des Moines, Iowafor about $2 billion. That business later was expanded and renamed Berkshire Hathaway Energy. Walter Scott Jr. speaks onstage during Celebrity Fight Night XVI on March 20, 2010 at the JW Marriott Desert Ridge in Phoenix.

Warren Buffett on Saturday criticized stock trading platforms like Robinhood that allow buying and selling for free as encouraging a ""gambling impulse."" ""There is nothing illegal to it, theres nothing immoral, but I dont think you build a society around people doing it,"" he said at Berkshire Hathaways annual meeting held virtually this year due to the coronavirus, The Guardian reported.

""If you cater to those gambling chips when people have money in their pocket for the first time and you tell them they can make 30 or 40 or 50 trades a day and youre not charging them any commission but your selling their order flow or whatever,"" he said.

Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett has indicated Greg Abel will be his likely successor. ""The directors are in agreement that if something were to happen to me tonight, it would be Greg whod take over tomorrow morning,"" Buffett told CNBC. In 2018, FOX Business reported that Abel was the leading candidate to succeed Buffett, based on insight from ""Buffettologists"" who have studied and scrutinized all things Berkshire. WARREN BUFFETT'S SUCCESSOR WILL BE GREG ABEL: REPORT During Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting on Saturday, Vice Chairman Charlie Munger signaled, ""Greg will keep the culture,"" according to reports. Here is a FOX Business roundup of five important things to know about the man who will be handed the keys to Buffett's empire. BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY REPORTS $11.7 BILLION PROFIT AS MANUFACTURING, SERVICE, RETAIL RECOVER FROM PANDEMIC Abel, described as affable, hails from Alberta, Canada, and is a University of Alberta-trained accountant with a bachelor of commerce degree who lives and breathes all forms of energy. Greg Abel in an undated file photo. (AP Photo/Nati Harnik) He trained as a chartered accountant with PricewaterhouseCoopers in San Francisco's office, before joining geothermal electricity producer CalEnergy in 1992. In 1999, CalEnergy acquired MidAmerican Energy, adopting its name, and Berkshire Hathaway acquired a controlling interest later that year. Abel became CEO of MidAmerican in 2008, and the company was renamed Berkshire Hathaway Energy in 2014. In 2018, Abel joined Berkshire Hathaway's board of directors as vice chairman of non-insurance operations. He currently serves as Berkshire Hathaway Energy's chairman, where he oversees more than 90 subsidiary businesses including BNSF railroad, AltaLink, L.P., BHE Pipeline Group, BHE Renewables, BHE U.S. Transmission, HomeServices of America, Inc., MidAmerican Energy Company, Northern Powergrid Holdings Company, NV Energy, Inc. and PacifiCorp. WARREN BUFFETT SAYS TRADING PLATFORMS LIKE ROBINHOOD ENCOURAGE A GAMBILING IMPULSE While Abel came out on top, both he and the CEO of Berkshire Hathway's insurance businesses, Ajit Jain, have been the primary contenders for the role. ""If, heaven forbid, anything happened to Greg tonight then it would be Ajit,"" Buffett said, adding that age is a determining factor for the board. ""Theyre both wonderful guys. The likelihood of someone having a 20-year runway though makes a real difference."" Berkshire Hathaway's Vice Chairman Ajit Jain speaks at Berkshire's annual meeting, held virtually for a second year, in Los Angeles, California, May 1, 2021.

(Getty Images/Reuters) Abel praised Buffett during 2019's shareholder meeting, telling FOX Business' Liz Claman that he's a ""great man."" ""I couldnt be more proud of Berkshire and obviously Warren and Charlie,"" Abel added while keeping a low profile at the meeting. Greg Abel Jim Weber, CEO of Berkshires Brooks Running company, said Abel has routinely visits the Seattle company to review its strategy and operations. Plus, Abel is available whenever needed, which Weber took advantage of last year when the coronavirus pandemic shut down all the retail stores that sell Brooks shoes, the Associated Press reported. In an interview with FOX Business last week, Weber noted how the company's brands gel. ""We are all working for our shareholders [Berkshire Hathaway's]"" he said, while also explaining Brooks' climate priorities which Abel is expected to prioritize like other corporate leaders. ""It was very easy for us to set goals that set on us a journey to be carbon neutral and to be inclusive as a running brand to invite everyone in from DEI (diversity, equity & inclusion) to sustainabilities"" GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE Jim Weber on Brooks Runnings success amid pandemic ""I wanted to get his insight into what he was seeing in the economy and at the other businesses. Hes seeing a large part of the economy just like Warren always has,"" Weber said. Abel encouraged Weber to focus on Brooks customers during the pandemic, which helped lead the company to shift to online sales and set sales records because people kept running even with the coronavirus restrictions. According to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Abel's total compensation for 2020 came in at just over $19 million. As vice chairman of non-insurance operations, Abel makes an annual base salary of $16 million, as well as an additional bonus of $3 million which is authorized by Buffett. In addition, Abel made $14,250 in ""other compensation"". Since 2018, it has been the responsibility of Abel to set the compensation for the CEOs of Berkshire's non-insurance businesses, while Jain sets the compensation for the CEOs of Berkshires insurance businesses. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS ""Mr. Jain and Mr. Abel use the same general criteria as had been used by Mr. Buffet. Many different incentive arrangements are utilized, with their terms dependent on such elements as the economic potential or capital intensity of the business,"" the filing adds. ""The incentives can be large and are always tied to the operating results for which the CEO has authority and are related to measures over which the CEO has control.""

FAQ - New Privacy Policy Berkshire Hathaway Vice Chairman Charlie Munger says bitcoin is useful to kidnappers and extortionists. Berkshire Hathaway vice chairman Charlie Munger has seen waves of criticism the past several days over the design of a forthcoming $1.5 billion dorm building he helped plan and will partially bankroll for the University of California, Santa Barbara. But the 97-year-old billionaire known as Warren Buffett's ""right-hand man"" is brushing off all the skeptics. Warren Buffett (L), CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, and vice chairman Charlie Munger attend the 2019 annual shareholders meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, May 3, 2019. (Photo: JOHANNES EISELE/AFP via Getty Images) (JOHANNES EISELE/AFP via Getty Images / Getty Images) Munger has pledged a significant chunk of change to the project  some $200 million  and has spent years collaborating with architects and university leadership on the design of the building modeled off a similar existing dorm he helped design and fund for the University of Michigan. Much of the criticism stems from the fact that 94% of the dorm's 4,500-bedrooms will not have windows. The hubbub came after a longtime consultant to the university, architect Dennis McFadden, quit over the design of the dorm, saying in a letter to school officials that the design of the forthcoming ""Munger Hall as a place for students to live is unsupportable from my perspective as an architect, a parent and a human being."" Exterior drawing of Munger Hall at UC Santa Barbara (UC Santa Barbara) WALTER SCOTT JR., BUSINESS PARTNER OF WARREN BUFFETT, DEAD AT 90 Critics then came out of the woodwork, with negative news reports, a flurry of online cynicism, and an op-ed from the Los Angeles Times which said the design ""takes dumb and multiplies it by a factor of willful ignorance squared."" Munger, for his part, has steadfastly defended the project and his role in it, pushing back against the naysayers and remaining unabashedly committed to seeing it through. So has the university. The billionaire told USA Today that he is amply qualified to help design the building after making his first million building apartments and has since built several homes for himself and family members. He said he expects Munger Hall will be a model for other dorms not just at UCSB but at campuses across the country.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy Mark Cuban, the billionaire owner of the Dallas Mavericks, blasts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., for demonizing the wealthy. Mark Cuban, the billionaire owner of the Dallas Mavericks slammed Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., for demonizing the wealthy and argued that taxing unrealized gains ""would be a disaster."" ""I dont think Elizabeth Warren knows at all what shes talking about when she deals with this,"" Cuban told ""Cavuto: Coast to Coast"" exclusively on Monday. ""I think she just likes to demonize people that are wealthy and thats fine."" ""Its a great political move for her, but I just dont think that they really understand the implications of taxing unrealized gains,"" he continued. ""People are going to have to sell things they otherwise would not sell. People are not going to make the same investments."" He noted that the type of investments he might make on the show he hosts ""Shark Tank"" could ""be completely different if I think Im going to have to pay unrealized gains."" ""I might have to retain capital so I could pay taxes on those unrealized gains so I know it would change behavior,"" he explained. ""I know it would change investment attitudes and approaches and I just think it would hurt the market."" A spokesperson for Warren did not immediately respond to FOX Business request for comment. Warrens plan to tax the net worth of the wealthiest Americans could reduce U.S. economic growth by 1.2% over the next 30 years, according to an analysis published earlier this year. The so-called ""ultra-millionaire tax"" would slash the country's gross domestic product -- the market value of all the goods and services produced within the U.S. -- by 0.6% in 2031 and 0.8% in 2040, according to the Penn Wharton Budget Model analysis. The tax would also have a detrimental effect on wages, reducing the hourly rate by 0.7% in 20313, 1% in 2040 and 1.2% in 2050, the model shows. Warren's proposal, which is nearly identical to the wealth tax that she introduced during her failed 2020 presidential campaign, would impose a 2% annual tax on the net worth of U.S. households above $50 million and would add an additional 1% levy on households worth more than $1 billion. Robert Wolf, Steve Moore on stimulus bill, wealth tax The Massachusetts Democrat estimates the Ultra-Millionaire Tax Act would affect about 100,000 households in the U.S., or roughly 0.05% of the population, and would generate about $3 trillion in revenue over the next decade based on estimates from Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, economists at the University of California, Berkeley. Last month President Biden said he supports a Democratic proposal to tax billionaires annually on their unrealized investment gains. Senate Finance Chairman Ron Wyden, D-Ore., has pushed for years to enact the proposal, which is one of several under consideration as part of Democratic efforts to cover the costs of Bidens $3.5 trillion budget reconciliation bill. The proposed change would require the wealthiest Americans to pay an annual tax on any gains in their asset portfolio, rather than after the assets are sold. Democrats argue the tax on unrealized investment gains and similar proposals would ensure all Americans pay their fair share, while critics say Wydens plan would be invasive and difficult for the IRS to implement. ""I do understand what their goal is, what I think their goal is, which I think is trying to help bring people up from the bottom, to help reduce income inequality, which I think is something we definitely have to address, but the way to do that is not just trying to tax unrealized gains,"" Cuban told host Neil Cavuto on Monday. He then offered a different solution. ""I would have no problem if there was incentives or programs that incented companies to provide stock to employees, all employees, and even did something that created a ratio in terms of stock thats issued to the CEO versus stock that is issued to the least paid employee because by offering stock, or warrants, or options to the least paid of all employees, you are giving them appreciable assets,"" Cuban explained. BIDEN DOUBLES DOWN ON $3.5 TRILLION PLAN THAT MANCHIN, MODERATE DEMS OPPOSE: 'NOT ABOUT SHORT-TERM STIMULUS' ""The only way to allow the bottom to keep up with the top earners and those with the top wealth, like myself, is not to change the incentives for investing and tax unrealized gains, its to enable appreciable assets for those that traditionally dont have them."" Thats the change that needs to happen,"" he stressed. Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban shoots before the game against the Los Angeles Lakers at American Airlines Center. (Kevin Jairaj-USA TODAY Sports / Reuters Photos) President Biden campaigned on a promise to raise taxes on the very richest Americans, unfurling just months after he was elected one of the biggest tax hikes in decades to help fund his $4 trillion economic agenda. As part of his sweeping ""Build Back Better"" agenda, Biden called for a slew of new taxes on corporations and the top sliver of U.S. households, including raising the corporate tax to 28%, nearly doubling the capital gains tax rate to 39.6% from 21%, restoring the top individual income tax rate to 39.6% from 37% and taxing capital gains at death. GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE However, last month, House Democrats released a blueprint to fund the $3.5 trillion climate and family plan that watered down some of the most ambitious elements of Biden's original tax plan. Under the outline from the House Ways and Means Committee, the corporate tax rate would be diluted to 26.5%  and would only apply to businesses earning more than $5 million in taxable income. The tax rate would actually decline to 18% for small businesses earning less than $400,000; all other businesses would continue to pay the current rate of 21%. House Democrats also weakened Biden's push to tax long-term capital gains as ordinary income for individuals earning more than $1 million. Instead of raising the top rate on capital gains to 39.6%, Democrats pushed it incrementally to 25%. Mark Cuban, the billionaire owner of the Dallas Mavericks in a wide-ranging interview on 'Cavuto: Coast-to-Coast,' explains markets, crypto investing, the potential for increased taxes and how the Biden administration is handling the U.S. economy. Taxes on long-term capital gains  generally classified as an asset that's held for more than one year  currently range from 0% to 20%, depending on a person's income. Wealthier investors are also subject to an additional 3.8% tax on long- and short-term capital gains that's used to fund ObamaCare. Short-term capital gains on assets sold within a year are typically taxed as ordinary income. The tax hikes laid out by the Ways and Means Committee could generate as much as $2.1 trillion in revenue, the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation estimated last month.

Elizabeth Warrens proposed wealth tax is the stupidest idea ever. The former White House economic adviser made the comment on Mornings with Maria on Tuesday arguing that the wealthy will find ways to avoid the tax by hiding their wealth. Warren, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and other Democrats on Monday proposed a 2% annual tax on the net worth of U.S. households above $50 million that would add an additional 1% levy on households worth more than $1 billion. ELIZABETH WARREN'S WEALTH TAX WOULD COST 100 RICHEST AMERICANS $78B Warrens legislation would tax the net worth of the wealthiest Americans in the proposal aimed at reducing income inequality in the U.S. The measure is nearly identical to the wealth tax that Warren, D-Mass., introduced during her failed 2020 presidential campaign. ""A wealth tax is popular among voters on both sides for good reason: because they understand the system is rigged to benefit the wealthy and large corporations,"" Warren said in a statement. ""As Congress develops additional plans to help our economy, the wealth tax should be at the top of the list to help pay for these plans because of the huge amounts of revenue it would generate."" Warren estimates the ""Ultra-Millionaire Tax Act"" would affect about 100,000 households in the U.S., or roughly 0.05% of the population, and would generate about $3 trillion in revenue over the next decade based on estimates from the University of California, Berkeley economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman. Hassett, vice president and managing director of The Lindsey Group and distinguished visiting fellow at the Hoover Institution, slammed the measure on Tuesday, explaining the way to think about a wealth tax. Right now, if you put your money in treasuries you get say less than 2% a year income, Hassett said. If the wealth tax is 3% a year then that means that youve got 150% income tax on wealth. Its a tax bigger than a 100% on the income from wealth. He noted that there have been dozens of countries around the world that have tried it, but everybody stopped right away because once you tax wealth that much, people find ways to avoid it or to get their wealthy the heck out of dodge. He then explained that if you want a progressive increase in income, you have a progressive consumption tax of some type, where you basically tax people when they buy stuff, if they buy more than 100,000 or 200,000 a year of stuff. DEMS UNVEIL $15 MINIMUM WAGE BILL, SAY THEY MAY USE RECONCILIATION TO PASS LEGISLATION Thats what countries around the world do when theyre trying to close revenue gaps like this and do it progressively, Hassett continued. He acknowledged that there are a couple of countries that may still have a wealth tax, but stressed that everybody else has found that it doesnt raise revenue and it causes all sorts of invasion. Speaking with host Maria Bartiromo on Tuesday, Hassett also weighed in on the debate to increase the federal minimum wage arguing that its a catastrophe waiting to happen. Hassett stressed that increasing the minimum wage to $15 would be a devastating blow to small businesses that have had an incredibly challenging year during the coronavirus pandemic and the related shutdowns. President Biden and congressional Democrats have pushed to raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour over the next four years as part of a broader coronavirus relief package. GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE Democrats hopes of including the minimum wage increase in their $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill seemed all but dead Monday as the Senate prepared to debate its own version of the House-passed aid package. Senate Budget Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders said he wanted Democrats to ignore the Senate parliamentarians ruling blocking the minimum wage increase. While it seemed the idea did not have the support among Democrats or the White House needed to succeed, Sanders, the Senates lead sponsor of the hike to $15, said he would force a vote on an amendment restoring the minimum wage increase. If you look at percentages of small businesses that have had to close down because of COVID, its still the case that 34% of small businesses that were open last January are still basically closed for business right now, Hassett noted on Tuesday. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS And so those guys, when they finally open up are thinking, OK well Im going to lose money now, but when I open up Im going to make some profit finally and thats why Im going to keep treading water, Im going to try to keep this business alive. and then if you tell them that all of a sudden their labor costs, which are 70% of costs for small businesses, are going to skyrocket because of a $15 minimum wage, my guess is a whole bunch of them give up right now, he continued, calling the potential move a devastating blow to all those small businesses. He added that he believes a minimum wage increase could lead to a wave of bankruptcies. FOX Business Megan Henney and The Associated Press contributed to this report.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy Omega Advisors CEO on his spat with the Democrat senator CEO of Omega Advisors and Former CEO of Goldman Sachs Asset Management Leon Cooperman joined ""Kudlow"" Tuesday to discuss his disagreements with Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and the American dream. Warren took a swipe at Cooperman during the 2020 presidential primaries, saying he was ""afraid of her;"" Cooperman said this was not the case. ""Not in the slightest,"" Cooperman said. He went on to explain that while giving a speech at Delivering Alpha, the moderator asked what he thought the market would do if Warren was elected. ""I said go down 20%,"" Cooperman said, noting that the next day, Warren tweeted at him to ""give others a shot at the American dream."" Cooperman went on to criticize what he called ""fair share baloney,"" and labeled Sen. Bernie Sanders, D-Vermont, a communist. ""Im the last person [Warren] should be attacking. I'm willing to pay more in taxes. We have to get away from tax-and-spend and fair share baloney. I get absolutely nuts with fair share... I am willing to give 50% to the government, okay.

Former CEO of Goldman Sachs Asset Management says the American dream is still alive but getting more difficult on 'Kudlow' Cooperman also accused Warren of inviting him to appear before a committee she controlled to ""embarrass"" him, and also said she ""libeled"" him. ""[Warren] says inside trader which she libeled me, I won the case was not convicted of insider trading...

""I've given away hundreds of millions of dollars to charity. I've taken the Giving Pledge with Warren Buffett. I've taken Jewish Giving pledge with Mike Leavitt. I intend to give away all my money.

However, it is unlikely that the Gates three children will see any impact on their inheritance cash  because Bill Gates has said on multiple occasions that he does not intend to leave them the bulk of the fortune. During a 2014 TED Talk, the host noted that the pair easily had enough money to make all of their children billionaires, but Bill Gates said that was not their plan. ""They won't have anything like that. They need to have a sense that their own work is meaningful and important,"" Bill Gates said. During an interview with The Daily Mail in 2011, Gates was asked about reports that he planned to each child $10 million  and while he did not confirm the exact number, he did say that it would be a ""miniscule portion"" of his wealth.

""I definitely think leaving kids massive amounts of money is not a favor to them,"" Gates said in response to a Reddit user's comment on the $10 million figure. ""Warren Buffett was part of an article in Fortune talking about this in 1986 before I met him and it made me think about it and decide he was right. Some people disagree with this but Melinda and I feel good about it."" Vicky Poumpouridis, a family and matrimonial attorney at Kasowitz Benson Torres LLP, told FOX Business that because the Gates' had planned to donate most of their wealth and not pass it down to their children, it is unlikely that those plans will be affected by the divorce. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS The caveat, however, is that unless the terms of what will be given to the children is strictly laid out in their separation agreement or another agreement, either Bill or Melinda Gates could change their mind about what they will leave their children at any time. It is also not clear whether both parties are expected to contribute to each childs $10 million inheritance, or whether it will come from one parent. Typically, separation agreements dont deal with inheritance where children are concerned, Poumpouridis explained. Instead they are concerned with assets the divorcing parties have inherited from their relatives. Poumpouridis said that she has worked through a handful of situations with high net worth clients where the divorce causes both parties to reach an agreement on what to pass along to their children  typically because they dont want the other party to have it for himself or herself. This can happen with a property like a house, Poumpouridis said.

Schiff has gone litigiously rogue for long enough in his official capacity that it is time for either Republicans on Capitol Hill or individual citizens to petition the California State Supreme Court's ethics arm to consider revoking his law license, Mark Levin told Fox News on Wednesday. Levin was reacting to news that Schiff, a California Democrat, had doctored an evidentiary text message from former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows to Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio the day prior to the Capitol riots. Jordan had forwarded a legal memo to Trump on January 5, 2021, in regard to certifying the 2020 election counts, according to The Federalist. A Democratic spokesman for the House January 6 Committee told The Federalist it ""inadvertently"" added extra punctuation to one part of the message and ""regrets the error."" House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite) Levin told ""Hannity"" that this is not the first time that Schiff  who read the text aloud on the record via videoconference  has purportedly run afoul of ethics or standard procedures: ""When it comes to Adam Schiff doctoring evidence, Adam Schiff is a lawyer and has a license in the state of California and maybe other places,"" said Levin. ""Rather than us just whining about this reprobate and unethical hack, lets do something about it: Lawyers are not free to doctor evidence particularly when they are doctoring evidence for the purpose of putting people in prison."" Levin called on Republicans or everyday citizens to file complaints in Sacramento: ""I'd ask the Republicans in Congress, but any citizen can do it  with the ethics arm of the Supreme Court of California and seek the license of Adam Schiff,"" he said. Schiff ""has got the media eating out of his hand,"" Levin later told host Sean Hannity. ""This guy is unethical. He doesnt deserve to be a member of the bar  he is worse than a slip-and-fall lawyer, he's a slip-and-fall congressman."" Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA). (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images) ((Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)) Levin later pivoted to Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who called for packing the Supreme Court because it purportedly is acting in ways damaging to democracy. Levin said that instead, the court is simply acting in ways Warren disagrees with  which in turn reveals a ""totalitarian"" streak in the Massachusetts lawmaker.

""She tried to use Native Americans to get to where she is. This thug wants to add 4 seats to the U.S. Supreme Court and 4 seats to the U.S. Senate: Enough seats until they control everything. Thats totalitarianism."" Charles Creitz is a reporter for Fox News Digital. He joined Fox News in 2013 as a writer and production assistant.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy The man who created Reddits WallStreetBets isnt who you think he is. He is 39 years old. He lives in Mexico City with his wife, a physician, and spends his weeks chasing after their 3-year-old twins and tending to his day job as a consultanthardly the sort of character one might associate with the roiling investing forum. He never imagined the Reddit community he created in 2012 would morph into a force so powerful that it would send GameStop Corp. shares into overdrive, nearly topple a hedge fund and leave professional money managers around the country staring at Twitter with their mouths agape. Its a little like watching one of those horror films where you can see the bad guy slowly going up the stairs, Jaime Rogozinski said. You see this train wreck happening in real time. VARNEY SAYS GAMESTOP IS OPPORTUNITY FOR ANTI-CAPITALISTS Mr. Rogozinski started WallStreetBets while working as an information technology consultant for the Inter-American Development Bank in Washington, D.C. Back then, he was single, making a decent living and looking for something to put some play money into. The only problem was the conventional wisdom of sticking with index-tracking funds bored him. Id go on different forums and ask them, Hey, what do you think about XYZ? And most times the sentiment would be Its too risky, dont try to pick stocks, youre never going to win, he said. The sober advice doled out in online communities like Bogleheads wasnt cutting it for him. Neither was the commentary of investment banking analysts on cable TV, fixated as they were on net present values, cash flows and price-to-earnings ratios. He decided to create a hub on message-board operator Reddit where like-minded people could gather to exclusively discuss the type of trades that would make a financial advisers skin crawl. Their approach would be more akin to gambling than spreadsheet analysis, and their motto something along the lines of YOLO, short for you only live once. The group counted only a few thousand subscribers in its first few yearsamong them, former pharmaceutical executive Martin Shkreli, who briefly served as a moderator before being convicted of securities fraud. (WallStreetBets Twitter account wished him good luck on his sentencing in March 2018.) AOC, WARREN SLAM WALL STREETERS FOR OUTRAGE OVER GAMESTOP RALLY, ACCUSE THEM OF TREATING MARKET LIKE A 'CASINO' Everything changed in 2019. Brokerage giants Fidelity Investments and Charles Schwab Corp. eliminated trading commissions. Interest in retail trading exploded, and the number of WallStreetBets subscribers swiftly crossed 500,000then one million during the market selloff of March 2020 and 2 million during the now-notorious campaign to drive GameStop shares higher. WallStreetBets users have driven headfirst into bets on everything from cruise-line operators hit by the pandemic to Lumber Liquidators Holdings Inc., the company embroiled in scandal following reports that it had installed flooring with excessive amounts of formaldehyde. And they have done so unabashedly, celebrating both their victories and their losses with gusto. (The community has dubbed posting screenshots of the latter, which frequently garners thousands of upvotes, as loss porn.) A lot of other places that discuss trading are really pretentious. At WallStreetBets its both, Look at my money! but also Look at all this money I lost, and I think thats whats refreshing to people, Mr. Rogozinski said. At its best, WallStreetBets showed trading didnt have to exclusively be a Patagonia-vested mans game. It was part of the nascent movement to democratize the investing world by breaking down the barriers to entry, even if some people would be stung by brutal losses along the way. Many years ago, Mr. Rogozinski recalls having to call Wachovia and shell out a $30 or so commission fee to buy Google Inc. shares. Now, anyone with a phone or an internet connection can get trading in minutesand show off their prowess or lack thereof to thousands of other individuals. A massive group of people have organized where they collectively have a seat at the poker table, which was previously invite-only, Mr. Rogozinski said. You cant ignore them anymore. Looking past the forums banter and Jerome Powell memes, it became clear to Mr. Rogozinski that the WallStreetBets community had a seedy underbellya side that he increasingly struggled to reckon with. First, there were the potential legal issues. As WallStreetBets grew, it faced accusationsoften lodged by angry short sellersof market manipulation. Moderators urged users not to make posts for the purpose of instigating or coordinating a group effort to move the market for a security. But that didnt silence the communitys critics. GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE Then there was the hate speech. Last year, Mr. Rogozinski decided to do some housekeeping and scrub some of the more distasteful content being shared in the community. In an off-Reddit chat room associated with WallStreetBets, he found language rife with obscenity, racism and antigay views that moderators let stand. There were a handful of mods who were straight-up white supremacists, he said. As a Jewish man married to a Mexican woman, he found it impossible to stomach. I have really thick skin and people can say whatever they want to me, but at some point theres a moral standpointlike with my kids, I dont want them to think, Well, they can say whatever they want about you, he said. Mr. Rogozinski wound up deleting the private chat room hosted on Discord where the offensive messages were exchanged. He also removed some of the moderators. The backlash was swift: Enough users chafed at his actionsalong with his promoting a book based on WallStreetBets, as well as an esports-style trading competition under the WallStreetBets namethat he was booted out by other moderators. He hasnt moderated the community since April. It has been impossible for him to escape his legacy, though. Just last week, he got a phone call from Citron Research founder Andrew Left. The short seller, who has been publicly betting against GameStop, begged Mr. Rogozinski for help. He said he had been attacked by hordes of angry investors online, some of whom had even targeted his children. A Reddit spokeswoman said the company prohibits users from posting or soliciting illegal transactions, doxing others and engaging in threats of violence. She added that the company would cooperate with valid law enforcement investigations or actions as needed. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS Mr. Rogozinski, unable to do much from the sidelines, was pained by Mr. Lefts call. When big investors like Carl Icahn and Bill Ackman get embroiled in a public spat, its like watching a heavyweight boxing match, he said. But when an online mob goes after an investors kids or spousethat crosses the line, he said. Its no longer what it used to be, he said.

Gavin Newsom held back details from the public and lawmakers about a $990 million state N95 mask contract with a China-based firm scrutinized by Congress. But now, a trove of 848 pages of documents is available to the public, obtained by government watchdog group Judicial Watch. The documents provide details on how the California Governors Office of Emergency Services selected BYD to make 300 million face masks for protection against COVID-19, a virus that originated in Wuhan. Earlier this year, state legislators tried to press Newsom to provide details about the deal, as one senior Democratic lawmakers called the deal ""murky."" The documentsmostly emailsshow the role of lobbyists in arranging the deal and that California deviated from normal procedures in awarding the contract. NEWSOM WONT SHARE DETAILS ON $1B MASK DEAL WITH CHINA ""It would surprise Americans to see how a major Chinese company can so easily access government officials,"" Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton told Fox News. ""I would think the California legislature would be interested in how this happened."" Newsom signed a second deal with BYD in July, this time for 400 million masks with a $316 million price tag. BYD, short for Build Your Dreams, was founded in 1995 and is listed on the Hong Kong and Shenzhen stock exchanges. The company usually makes electric vehicles, widely sold for fleets throughout the United States. In 2008, Warren Buffetts Berkshire Hathaway purchased a near quarter stake in the China-based firm. The company has 30 industrial plants across the globe, including in Los Angeles, and specializes in green-energy electronics, automobiles and rail transit. The masks were made in China. The company secured other government contracts 2020 to supply electric-powered vehicles to Florida, Maryland, Missouri and New Jersey. Also, in 2020, BYD filed defamation lawsuits against Vice Media for a critical story the outlet published in April and a separate lawsuit against the Alliance for American Manufacturing. The 2019 National Defense Authorization Act included a provision to ban the use of federal funds to purchase public transportation vehicles from China- affiliated firms. This affects BYD but would not apply to masks. The provision takes effect at the end of 2021. NEWSOM'S OFFICE REFUSES RECORDS REQUEST ON 'MURKY' $1B MASK DEAL WITH CHINESE COMPANY The privately owned and publicly traded firm is neither state-owned nor associated with the Chinese Communist Party, BYD spokesman Frank Girardot said, insisting the real story behind the 2019 NDAA restriction is a lobbying effort by competitors. ""Its an effort by our competitors to keep us out of the market,"" Girardot said. ""Quite frankly, they dont make the same quality of product that we do."" The masks for California were made in China because there was already a BYD plant there making masks and ""there was no time to act"" to build a new factory in the U.S., Girardot said. The industrial park in Shenzhen, China, is the ""worlds largest mass-produced face mask plant,"" according to the BYD press release in March. In March 2020, the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee held a hearing on China-sponsored companies, including BYD. That same month, records show, California lobbyist Mark Weideman contacted Newsoms chief of staff, Ann OLeary, on March 21, 2020, providing a copy of a Business Insider article about BYD titled, ""A Chinese Electric Car Maker Backed by Warren Buffett Re-Tooled to Make Face Masks When Covid-19 Hit  Now It Says Its the Worlds Largest Mask Factory."" Weideman said BYD would donate 50,000 masks to California, along with hand sanitizer, and asked if someone could ""notify GGN"" (possibly referring to Gov. Gavin Newsom) to ""hopefully execute on BYDs offer to help California, a place they and their unionized workforce call home for their North American operations."" Abby Browning of the Office of Emergency Services responded to Weideman. More advocacy came on March 28, 2020, when San Francisco Employees Retirement System board member Brian Stansbury introduced Grady Joseph, the Office of Emergency Services' assistant director of recovery operations, and Paul Teng of Himalaya Capital through an email, the records show. Teng followed up with a message to Joseph, writing, ""We have a deep relationship with BYD which is now the largest mask maker in the world,"" noting he facilitated one order and added, ""Happy to make the same connection as well. My number is below if you need to reach me."" A provision of the California-BYD contract guarantees that no material will be made in sweatshops, which BYD has faced criticism for. Before the contract was finalized, Office of Emergency Services Assistant Chief Counsel Jennifer Bollinger asked BYD counsel John Zhuang in an April 3 email why BYD used ""Global Healthcare Product Solutions, LLC.,"" saying, ""I understood this to be a contract directly with BYD North America."" Zhuang responded, ""BYDs contract manufacturing division started Global Healthcare Product Solutions earlier this year to sell healthcare products in the US."" GET THE FOX NEWS APP BYD had to refund $247 million of Californias $495 million down payment in an amendment to the agreement, apparently because BYD wasnt able to meet the deadline of getting approval from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) to make the N95 masks. California extended the deadline from April 30 to May 31, 2020. BYD announced on May 13 that it was working with NIOSH on a ""Corrective Action Plan"" and would resubmit its application for approval. The press release said the federal agency found ""no issues with the quality of the masks"" but said the delay in approval was ""related to documentation control paperwork."" California Office of Emergency Services spokesman Brian Ferguson acknowledged the inquiry on Friday and said he was unsure the agency would have a comment, ""But will keep you posted if we have anything on this."" Ferguson and others in the communications department did not respond to follow-up inquiries. Another provision in the contract showed what appeared to be an exemption from liability if there was a problem with masks, saying, ""in no event shall Seller be liable for any consequential, special, incidental, indirect or punitive damages"" and that BYD ""makes no warranties or representations."" BYD spokesman Girardot said the company is responsible for any mask problems and called the language ""boilerplate"" for contracts.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy FOX Business' Susan Li and Constellation Research CEO Ray Wang discuss Elon Musk being chosen as Time's 2021 Person of the Year and Apple set to become the first $3 trillion company. There is no disputing that Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are among the wealthiest people on the planet. However, because the personal fortunes of these two self-made billionaires are dependent on their stakes in their companies and other investments, their net worths can rise and fall with the stock market. However, here's what we know about who the richest person in the world is, as of December 2021. Although Forbes named Jeff Bezos as the richest person in the world in October 2021 with an estimated net worth of $177 billion, by December 2021, just two months later, Elon Musk had surged ahead. Forbes estimated that the Tesla CEO had added another $110 billion to his personal wealth at the end of 2021, due to several factors, including increases in Tesla's stock price and SpaceX's valuation. This now makes Musk, not Bezos, the current richest person in the world, with a net worth that's thought to be somewhere around $266 billion. SpaceX founder and Tesla CEO Elon Musk is reported to have added $110 billion to his personal fortune at the end of 2021. (Reuters Photos) While he might have been recently booted out of the top spot by Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos is currently the second-richest person in the world by several outlets' calculations. His personal net worth at the end of 2021 is thought to be around the $196 billion mark  not too shabby for someone who stepped down from his role as Amazon CEO in July 2021 after 27 years of leading the company. For a brief period of time in 2021, French businessman Bernard Arnault reportedly made the leap to the second-richest person position, and even had a few weeks in the number one position, before dropping back down to number three. Jeff Bezos is still one of the richest people in the world despite stepping down as Amazon CEO in mid-2021. ( Associated Press / AP Newsroom) COULD JEFF BEZOS BECOME A TRILLIONAIRE?

After a two-year pandemic-induced haitus, the only shareholder meeting of its kind on the planet is back and could break its own stunning record. What began in a small cafeteria decades ago today has gotten so huge it sells out the very arena where Taylor Swift and Paul McCartney perform. This weekend, tens of thousands from around the world will descend on Omaha, Nebraska--the birthplace of the ""Oracle of Omaha,"" a.k.a. Warren Buffett. GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE The price of admission? A single share of Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate hes run for 57 years. Not only is Buffett alive and kicking at age 91, the chairman and CEO of the $307 billion conglomerate--a behemoth with 80+ businesses under its corporate umbrella--will burst onto the stage Saturday with the power to declare that Berkshires stock performance has trounced the market... again. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett (Fox Business Network) Buffett himself is predicting a record-breaking crowd of more than 40,000, although Berkshire later put out a statement downplaying that number. But for a man who regularly deals in odds thanks to his massive insurance business, hes never been one to casually throw out predictions involving numbers. He could believe that with so many Americans eager to travel post COVID-19 lockdowns, why not come to the capitalist circus whose #1 attraction is an oddity more fascinating than any three-headed snake: two elderly self-made billionaires--Buffett and his 98-year-old best friend and Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger--who, decade after decade, have crushed stock market benchmarks and the performances of the worlds top fund managers. Theyve done it simply by adhering to disciplined, plain vanilla investing rules they readily share, and yet few if any manage to mimic. Warren Buffett (L), CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, and vice chairman Charlie Munger attend the 2019 annual shareholders meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, May 3, 2019. (JOHANNES EISELE/AFP via Getty Images / Getty Images) The two sit alone on stage and for hours take questions from the crowd. This year, Buffett and Munger will share the spotlight with Buffetts eventual successor, Vice Chairman Greg Abel, along with Vice Chairman Ajit Jain, who runs Berkshires vast insurance business. WARREN BUFFETT'S CHARITY LUNCH RETURNS, BUT FOR THE LAST TIME All four will come armed with a stock performance shareholders are sure to cheer: over the past twelve months, Berkshire shares have returned 30% vs. the S&Ps 8%. HOW HAS BUFFETT DONE IT? With a net worth of $120 billion today, Buffett is the sixth richest person in the world but when he started his investment company back in 1965, he was just the Nebraska neighbor next door, so shy he forced himself to take the Dale Carnegie course How to Win Friends and Influence People so he could face potential investors. He went door-to-door asking friends and family to take a chance on the kid from Omaha who said he could grow their hard-earned money by investing in and outright buying cash-producing companies that churned out unique, quality products that were best in class: think Geico Insurance, American Express, Coca-Cola, Sees Candies. In fact, Sees made so much money that after he bought the entire company, he used its cash flow to fund the purchase of other businesses, including an entire railroad. Berkshire Hathaway Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett (AP Photo/Nati Harnik) He also deftly collects huge blocks of stock in companies that fit his requirements. Berkshires $340 billion stock portfolio is a green whale--chock full of Apple, Bank of America, Kroger, and more recently, HP Inc. and Occidental Petroleum. BUFFETT'S BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY ADDS STAKE IN HP; SHARES JUMP Buffetts shareholders wont arrive entirely happy, though. Hes sitting on a cash pile of $144 billion, most of it parked in low-yielding Treasuries. The chintzy returns havent thrilled investors who have already asked why he hasnt put the money to work. Yes, hes done share buybacks, $27 billion last year alone, but thats barely made a dent. Buffett refuses to pay a dividend, preferring instead to reinvest earnings in new businesses, and yet, he also complains that there isnt much out there that checks his boxes *and* isnt overvalued. THE 800-LB. BULL IN THE ROOM Perhaps the number one question for the crowd: will this be the last in-person meeting featuring the Warren & Charlie show? Both have failing physical faculties. Buffett is hard of hearing, and at 98, Mungers mind is as sharp as ever (his new hobby is architecture) but hes mostly wheelchair-bound with limited eyesight. (At the 2017 meeting, the two came out on stage and Buffett joked, ""Thats Charlie and Im Warren. You can tell us apart because he can hear and I can see."") Greg Abel and Ajit Jain (Getty Images/Reuters) While hes named his Abel and Jain his successors, he said in a recent interview that Abel, who will run all non-insurance operations, ""hasnt started warming up yet,"" perhaps an indication that Buffett is far from loosening his grip on the Berkshire scepter, let alone handing it over to Abel. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS Could that be because Buffett worries Berkshire stock will sell off if he does? Hes often said that Jain and Abel, along with his stock investment chiefs Ted Wechsler and Todd Combs, are smarter than he is, but dont believe it. While each is brilliant in his field, the mere fact that Buffett has positioned four people to do the job he single-handedly did for years speaks volumes. No wonder shareholders come from as far away as China and Australia to hang on his every word. Liz Claman will be reporting live from the Berkshire Hathaway Shareholder weekend beginning Friday.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy Blanke Schein Wealth Management CIO Robert Schein discusses where to put money to work in a volatile market on ""The Claman Countdown."" Warren Buffett has completed the $11.6 billion acquisition of the Alleghany Corp. The deal is the billionaire's largest since acquiring Precision Castparts for $37.2 billion in 2016. The insurer became a wholly owned subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway. Alleghany shareholders received $848.02 cash per share. The purchase, announced in March, will further expand Berkshire's insurance operations. Buffett's Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate owns Geico, Gen Re and a number of other insurance companies. Alleghanys property and casualty insurance subsidiaries include reinsurer Transatlantic Holdings, specialty insurance underwriters RSUI Group and CapSpecialty. Alleghany also adds additional companies to Berkshire's portfolio. Alleghany owns steel fabricator W&W|AFCO Steel and toy company Jazwares. Berkshire owns BNSF Railway, several major utilities and dozens of manufacturing and retail companies, including Dairy Queen, See's Candy and fractional aircraft owner NetJets. WARREN BUFFETT'S BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY BOOSTS STAKE IN OCCIDENTAL PETROLEUM Warren Buffett, chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, speaks following the annual Berkshire Hathaway shareholders meeting on May 5, 2019, in Omaha, Nebraska. (AP Photo/Nati Harnik) Alleghany chair and CEO Joe Brandon will continue to run the unit. Edward Jones analyst Jim Shanahan said Brandon, who previously ran a different Berkshire insurance company, could one day be a candidate to replace Vice Chair Ajit Jain and oversee all of Berkshires insurance companies. Berkshire's last major acquisition came in 2016 when it paid $32.36 billion to buy aviation parts maker Precision Castparts. Buffett has always been reluctant to overpay for acquisitions, and he has said Berkshire faces more competition for deals these days from private-equity firms. PRECISION CASTPARTS A 'PERFECT FIT' FOR WARREN BUFFETT'S BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY, ANALYST SAYS But Buffett has put more than $51 billion to work in the stock market this year, including buying up roughly $12 billion worth of Occidental Petroleum stock and another $20 billion worth of Chevron shares to bet big on oil production. Still, Berkshire was sitting on $105.4 billion cash at the end of the second quarter. It will use some of that at the start of next year to more than double its stake in the Pilot chain of more than 800 truck stops across 44 states and six Canadian provinces. The terms of Buffett's 2017 agreement call for it to boost its stake from its current 38.6% ownership to 80% in 2023. That will leave the Haslam family that runs the business based in Knoxville, Tennessee, with a 20% stake. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX BUSINESS APP Shanahan estimated that the Pilot deal will use at least $3.5 billion, but Berkshire has never disclosed the terms of that deal. In addition to owning more than 90 operating companies, Berkshire holds a sizable investment portfolio with major stakes in Apple, Bank of America, American Express and Coca-Cola, among other companies.

Warren Buffett had no answers but plenty of caution about the threat and impact of nuclear weapons, saying that every day is living with ""flipping a coin."" ""The world is flipping a coin every day whether people who can literally destroy the planet as we know it and will do it,"" Buffett said to an audience of Berkshire Hathaway shareholders Saturday. ""Unfortunately, the major problem is that people who have large stocks of nuclear weapons and ICBMs."" AT 91, WARREN BUFFETT STILL SPRINTS CIRCLES AROUND WALL STREET""They talk about using tactical nuclear weapons ... if someone is willing to kill hundreds of thousands of people with tactical nuclear weapons, why would they stop there?"" he added. ""Its a very, very dangerous world."" The question, submitted by a shareholder, asked about the impact of nuclear weapons on Berkshires operations and outlooks. The company maintains a number of insurance operations, and a nuclear attack would severely impact the companys operations as a result. ""For certain things, we don't write policies on because we wouldn't be able to make good on them anyway,"" Buffett said. ""And everybody would know we wouldn't be able to make on them. ""So you have that risk. And there's nothing Berkshire can protect you against."" BUFFETT COMPARES WALL STREET TO GAMBLERS, WOULD TRUST MONKEYS OVER FINANCIAL ADVISORS The concern over nuclear weapons has increased in the past month as Russian President Vladimir Putin has raised threats of nuclear attack and tested new weapons, such as the Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile  a weapon that Putin says would provide ""food for thought for those who ... try to threaten our country.""

FAQ - New Privacy Policy FOX Business host Charles Payne provides insight on investing in the stock market on 'Making Money with Charles Payne.' Warren Buffett certainly sees this as the season of giving. The billionaire investor donated more than $750 million in Berkshire Hathaway stock on Wednesday to the four foundations run by his family. Wednesday's donations mark the first time the 92-year-old has made a second major gift within the same year. Buffett gives annual gifts to five charities each summer, but this extra round of giving didn't include the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. WARREN BUFFETT PORTRAIT: HIGH-TECH ART RAISES $75K FOR CHARITY Billionaire investor and philanthropist Warren Buffett (Daniel Zuchnik/WireImage / Getty Images) Buffett started giving annual donations to the same five charities in 2006 when he unveiled a plan to give away his fortune over time, with the Gates Foundation receiving the biggest donations. A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission showed Buffett gave 1.5 million Class B shares to the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, named for his first wife. He also gave 300,000 Class B shares apiece to the three foundations run by his children: the Sherwood Foundation, the Howard G. Buffett Foundation and the NoVo Foundation. In June, he gave 11 million Class B shares to the Gates Foundation, 1.1 million B shares to the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation and 770,218 shares apiece to his children's three foundations. WARREN BUFFETT'S FINAL CHARITY LUNCH SETS EBAY RECORD Warren Buffett (C) poses for a picture with his children Peter Buffett and Susie Buffett. ( (Photo by Bennett Raglin/WireImage) / Getty Images) It wasn't immediately clear what prompted the new donations this week. The Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation has been a major supporter of abortion rights, making large gifts to Planned Parenthood and other groups. Buffett hasn't announced any changes in his giving plans since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade earlier this year. Susie Buffett, 69, uses her Sherwood Foundation to strengthen early childhood education and support a number of projects around Buffett's hometown of Omaha where she also lives.

The legendary investor, who has been Berkshire's Chairman and CEO for decades, holds 229,016 A shares and 276 B shares to give him control of more than 30% of Berkshires voting stock. He has been gradually giving his shares away to five foundations, with most of his donations going to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Abel already oversees all of Berkshire's noninsurance businesses, and Buffett has said that he will one day take over as CEO as part of the company's succession plan. However, the 92-year-old Buffett says he has no plans to retire. Investors will no doubt be encouraged to see Abel buying some Berkshire shares, but this summer he sold back to the company for $870 million his stake in Berkshire's Iowa-based utility division that he used to lead. So even after these recent purchases of Berkshire stock, he has a significantly smaller investment in Berkshire than he used to. Edward Jones analyst Jim Shanahan said he's glad to see Abel investing in Berkshire shares because it ""demonstrates his alignment with shareholders."" But he said it's a relatively small investment given Abel's wealth and compared to his previous stake in Berkshire Hathaway Energy.

Joseph Bankman, the father of embattled FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, helped Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., draft legislation to simplify the tax code in 2016. After she introduced the Tax Filing Simplification Act in April 2016, Warren  who currently chairs both the Senate Banking Committee's economic policy subcommittee and Senate Finance Committee's fiscal responsibility subcommittee  touted the support of Bankman and dozens of other law professors and economists. Bankman, a law professor at Stanford University, penned a letter of support for the bill, which other scholars signed. ""We, the 54 undersigned law professors and economists, support the Tax Filing Simplification Act of 2016, introduced by Senator Warren to simplify tax filing for all American taxpayers,"" the letter stated. ""These provisions should substantially reduce record-keeping and filing costs,"" it continued.

The Stanford scholar was involved in writing the bill, which ultimately stalled in committee, according to Fortune magazine. WHAT IS THE ALLEGED CONNECTION BETWEEN SAM BANKMAN-FRIED, FTX, DEMOCRATS AND UKRAINE? Despite its failure to move forward to a floor vote, the legislation received endorsements from Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.; Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I.; Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis.; then-Sen. Tom Udall, D-N.M.; Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H.; Ed Markey, D-Mass.; and then-Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn. Bankman, meanwhile, has given thousands of dollars to Democratic campaigns, according to Federal Election Commission data. His largest donations were two $2,900 contributions to failed Oregon congressional candidate Carrick Flynn, a Democrat who was financially backed by an affiliated super PAC to which Bankman's son donated millions of dollars. Bankman also donated $2,500 to Warren's campaign in 2011. Warren was first elected to her seat in 2012 when she handily defeated incumbent Republican Sen. Scott Brown.

Warren Buffett-backed BYD said in a filing on Tuesday that it is shelving the spinoff of BYD Semiconductor and the companys listing on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange until an unspecified date. It said it instead plans to accelerate investments in expanding its chip-making capacity, building on a recent investment in a chip factory in Jinan, in eastern China. ""BYD Semiconductor intends to seize the time window to make large-scale investment in wafer production capacity,"" the company said in a filing with the Shenzhen exchange, adding that it planned unspecified future investments in chip capacity. It said it would revisit the spinoff after the investments are complete and when the timing is appropriate. The BYD subsidiary primarily builds chips used to regulate electrical power, optical sensors and other components used in electric vehicles. It focuses on supplying chips to BYD itself and has no outside revenue, said Hui He, a China semiconductor analyst at research firm Omdia. TESLA BREAKS ITS CHINA FACTORY DELIVERY RECORD BUT TRAILS BYD BYD is Chinas largest maker of electric vehicles and competes with Tesla Inc. and other major auto brands globally. It also supplies batteries to outside vehicle makers. Fueling its growth and keeping down costs, BYD has sought to vertically integrate much of its supply chain. It produces its own batteries and some of its semiconductors, helping it secure two of the most crucial EV components at a time when rivals are wrestling with supply-chain disruptions and chip shortages. CHIP SHORTAGE THREATENS TO CURB CHINA'S MOMENTUM AS EV GLOBAL LEADER BYD said in a 2021 filing outlining the spinoff that the transaction would allow the semiconductor unit to expand into a wider array of chips for industrial uses, home appliances, new energy products and consumer electronics, as well as boost the units profitability. Halting the planned spinoff comes as China has seen fast-growing demand for electric vehicles. Earlier this month, BYD said sales of its plug-in hybrid and battery-electric passenger vehicles more than tripled to 1.4 million units this year through October. BYD commanded 32% of the market for such vehicles in China in the third quarter, up from 21% a year earlier, according to Goldman Sachs. New vehicles are parked for ready for export from a dockyard in Yantai in eastern China's Shandong province on Oct. 13, 2022. China's economic growth accelerated in the latest quarter but still was among the slowest in decades as the country wrestled (AP Newsroom) In 2008, BYD attracted an investment of $230 million from Mr. Buffetts Berkshire Hathaway. Its Hong Kong shares have soared more than 10-fold since. In its 2021 annual report, Berkshire Hathaway disclosed a 7.7% stake in the company. In August, the investment firm sold $46 million worth of shares in the company. The industry has seen growth despite the broader slowdown in Chinas economy, thanks in part to favorable government policies that include cash subsidies for buyers and purchase-tax exemptions.

Supply had struggled to meet demand for microchips with the recent boom in electric vehicle production. (Reuters/Florence Lo / Reuters Photos) Asia has seen a boom in public offerings by electric-vehicle companies and the firms that supply them this year, with tens of billions of dollars raised to date. Despite the turbulence in global markets, Chinas domestic stock exchanges have seen 352 companies debut, raising 534 billion yuan, or about $76 billion, nearly catching up to last years total for the whole year.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy Kennedy Party Panel debate how much the highest earners should pay in income tax. Tesla CEO Elon Musk clapped back at Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who claimed that he had paid ""zero"" in taxes in 2018. Musk cited his multi-billion-dollar anticipated tax bill for 2021. ""Elon Musk in 2018, we've actually seen his tax returns,"" Warren said Sunday. ""You know how much he paid in taxes, one of the richest people in the world? Zero."" Musk paid no federal income taxes in 2018, according to a ProPublica report. Musk reportedly lives off of loans he takes from Tesla shares that he owns through stock options. MUSK SAYS HIS TAX BILL FOR 2021 WAS OVER $11 BILLION Musk responded to a Twitter post that quoted part of Warren's claim but omitted the reference to 2018. ""You know how much [Elon Musk] paid in taxes, one of the richest people in the world? Zero!"" the post read. 13 August 2021, Brandenburg, Grunheide: Elon Musk, Tesla CEO, stands in the foundry of the Tesla Gigafactory during a press event. (Getty Images) ""Will visit IRS next time Im in DC just to say hi, since I paid the most taxes ever in history for an individual last year,"" Musk replied on Twitter. ""Maybe I can have a cookie or something ..."" For 2021, Musk said he anticipated spending more in taxes than some countries make in a year. He said he would pay over $11 billion, a number that comports with Bloomberg News reporting that he could face a bill of more than $10 billion if he exercises his stock options. Bloomberg News reported that this sum could be the largest individual payment to the Internal Revenue Service.

Wendell Jeffson can vividly recall the moment he briefly stepped out of the Yearning for Zion ranch, which was run by his father, polygamous cult leader Warren Jeffs. Jeffson was about seven years old when he first saw a highway in Eldorado, Texas. It was his first glimpse into an outside world he had never experienced before. ""I saw cars zooming down the highway  it was crazy,"" he recalled to Fox News Digital. ""I had never seen anything like that. I was just so enthralled with the idea of going 40 miles an hour. It was like going to another planet."" Jeffson, along with his mother Vicki Thompson and his sister Sarah, have come forward to share their story about life inside the polygamous denomination in Peacocks new true-crime documentary, ""Preaching Evil: A Wife on the Run with Warren Jeffs."" Warren Jeffs is the subject of a new true-crime documentary on Peacock. (Photo by Steve Marcus-Pool/Getty Images) It explores how Jeffs rose to power within the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS) during the 90s, and how he was arrested and convicted following accusations of assault, rape and child abuse. JOHN WAYNE GACY'S VICTIMS CAN STILL BE IDENTIFIED, NETFLIX FILMMAKER SAYS: 'GAVE ME CHILLS' The four-part series features a sit-down with Naomi Jessop, one of Jeffs ex-wives who served as his personal scribe, as well as interviews with the authorities involved in the raid of the compound and the attorneys that later brought Jeffs to justice. ""I think what really compelled me to get our story out there is, unfortunately, theres a lot of people that get involved in these types of environments and go down a similar path,"" Jeffson explained. ""We were very sheltered. I didnt see any outside world perspectives. And when I came out into this world, I wanted to experience all those things, but I really wanted to show people that, after I left, I didnt have to go down any harmful roads. I found a way to take those negative experiences that Ive gone through and turn them into a more positive future for me."" Warren Jeffs with Vicki Thompson, Wendell Jeffson's mother. (Peacock) Polygamy is a legacy of the early teachings of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, but the mainstream church abandoned the practice in 1890 and now strictly prohibits it. The FLDS broke away from the Mormon church and was formed so that members could continue practicing plural marriage. It was headquartered on the Utah-Arizona border. Jeffsons grandfather, Rulon T. Jeffs, took power in 1986 and ruled until his death in 2002 at age 92. He left behind an estimated 75 widows and 65 children. Rulon Jeffs passed away in 2002 at age 92. He left behind an estimated 75 widows and 65 children. (Photo By Helen H. Richardson/The Denver Post via Getty Images) Following Rulons death, Jeffs took over as the groups prophet. In the FLDS, it is believed the prophet can speak directly to God and direct which male members can enter heaven. The prophet can also perform marriages and assign wives to their husbands. In pleasing the prophet, loyal members are rewarded more wives, who ""belong"" to their spouses for eternity, NPR reported. Members believed that each man must have at least three wives. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER ""I didnt know any differently,"" Jeffson said of his childhood. ""You cant compare the life I had with the life I have now. Its like I was blindfolded without even knowing I had the blindfold on. Its all you know. I was happy, to be honest with you. I was never abused physically. Emotionally  thats another story. We were brainwashed. But ... I had a great work ethic. I had a lot of siblings. And, of course, I had a great mom. I lived in a bubble."" Jeffson said, growing up, he had a good relationship with his father. But once he became the leader of the FLDS, ""that relationship was eliminated."" It is believed that Jeffs had about 78 wives and at least 60 children. ""He didnt spend time with me,"" said Jeffson. ""I didnt have an opportunity to bond with him at all. It got to the point where I would only see him once every few months. And when I would see him, itd be very brief ... It just felt like he was passing through. Wendell Jeffson, who was cast out of FLDS at age 14, shared his account on 'Preaching Evil'. (Court) ""As I got a little bit older, he started to write to me a few more times, but we never had a strong relationship. Unfortunately, negative things were usually written. There were some positive things, but it was usually about something Ive done wrong."" Jeffson said he would contribute to the workload as Jeffs built what he described as Yearning for Zion. At four years old, he would pick weeds out of the flower beds and work in the gardens. He would clean bathrooms, help make breakfast and ensure the home was tidy at all times. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""I grew up thinking we were building a haven where we would be the only ones left, and everyone else would be wiped off from the face of the Earth,"" said Jeffson. Even as a child, Jeffson questioned his faith. It is believed that Warren Jeffs had about 78 wives and at least 60 children. (Photo by Jud Burkett/Bloomberg via Getty Images) ""Race was huge in the FLDS,"" he said. ""We were taught very strongly that Black people were very evil. I remember, at a young age, I had to go off the compound and go to the hospital, which most people didnt have an opportunity to do. And we were treated extremely well by different people, including some Black people. I began to wonder at that point, Why were they so bad? I also wondered why I couldnt have short sleeves, why there were certain foods I couldnt eat, like candy. And toys  I wanted toys like any kid. We didnt have those things."" In 2006, Jeffs, who was on the FBIs Top 10 Most Wanted List, was arrested during a routine traffic stop near Las Vegas. He was booked on two out-of-state warrants issued in Utah and Arizona on charges of unlawful sexual conduct with a minor and rape as an accomplice. IDAHO MAN RECALLS HOW EVIL ESTRANGED WIFE, A FORMER NURSE, COMMITTED MURDER IN DOC: I FELT DISGUSTED ""I remember [as a child], that was devastating to me,"" said Jeffson. ""I didnt know if Id ever see him again. Even though I didnt have a relationship with him, I was still very concerned, and I had a love for him as my father and as the prophet of the church. We were terrified."" A call suddenly came into the San Angelo domestic abuse hotline. It was from a girl, who said she was 16 years old and living on the Yearning for Zion ranch. Law enforcement entered the property looking for the teen, who identified herself as Sarah. It turned out to be a hoax. The call actually came from a 33-year-old woman living in Colorado Springs. In this handout provided by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), polygamist Warren Steed Jeffs is pictured on an FBI Ten Most Wanted poster. Jeffs, the fugitive leader of a polygamist Mormon sect, was arrested by a Nevada Highway Patrol trooper during a traffic stop. Jeffs was wanted in Utah and Arizona on charges linked to allegations of arranging marriages between men and underage girls. (Handout by Federal Bureau of Investigation via Getty Images) Still, the details of underage marriage and sexual abuse prompted law enforcement to raid the 1,700-acre property in 2008. The Department of Family and Protective Serves ordered the removal of about 437 children from the ranch, Texas Monthly reported. Jeffson, who was about six or seven at the time, was one of them, along with his sister.

(Photo by Khampha Bouaphanh/Fort Worth Star-Telegram/Tribune News Service via Getty Images) ""I remember those Texas rangers and the SWATs coming in with rifles and everything,"" he said. ""I didnt know if I was going to survive. We had been taught that these people wanted to eliminate us. It felt like it only confirmed what Warren Jeffs had taught us."" FLORIDA MOM RECALLS 12-YEAR-OLD CHILD'S MURDER: 'YOU JUST NEVER KNOW WHO'S AROUND YOU' Jeffson said he was separated from his mother for six weeks. He promised the matriarch he would stay with his sister. During what he described as ""the six longest weeks of my life,"" he and Sarah were at a state shelter. He and Sarah were eventually reunited with their mother. Warren Jeffs is serving a life sentence in Texas for sexually assaulting girls he considered brides. (Photo by Washington County Sheriff via Getty Images) According to prosecutors, Jeffs engaged in sexual abuse with two girls, ages 12 and 14. The documentary showed how a key piece of evidence against Jeffs was an audio recording of him instructing his ""spiritual bride,"" as well as several other young women, how to please him sexually. In 2007, Jeffs tried to hang himself in a Utah jail. He was force-fed at an Arizona jail in 2009. Then in 2011, he was sentenced to life in prison. That same year, he was put in a medically-induced coma after fasting in a Texas prison. Wendell Jeffson with his sister Sarah (center), mother Vicki Thompson (right) and his baby sibling. (Courtesy of Wendell Jeffson) Jeffson said, at age 14, he and his family were cut off from FLDS. In 2017, they relocated to New Harmony, Utah, where several former members have embarked on new lives. Jeffsons mother has remarried. As for Jeffson, hes engaged and traveling out of the country. After Jeffson filmed his account for the documentary, he changed his last name. ""I couldnt be happier,"" he said. ""I want to create my own story, my own path. I want to move on."" PLAYBOY BUNNY ADRIENNE POLLACKS 1973 DEATH STILL RAISES QUESTIONS, SISTER SAYS: IT NEVER MADE SENSE TO US Jeffson said he doesnt have any relationship with Jeffs, and hes content with that. ""No matter what he says about us today, he has no control over my life,"" said Jeffson. ""Ive found so much love and appreciation out in this world."" Wendell Jeffson and his fiancee. (Courtesy of Wendell Jeffson) Jeffson is aware his story is different from the many others who either left or were cast out of the FLDS. The group has lost hundreds of members in recent years. In 2017, Jeffs brother Lyle was convicted on food stamp fraud charges. Some followers still consider Jeffs to be their prophet and believe he was wrongfully convicted. ""We werent crazy,"" Jeffson reflected. ""He was cunning, very manipulative in the way he made everyone love him so much. And he hid it for so long. Theres no hiding that he is a pedophile and deserves to be in prison. He ruined so many lives. I hope people understand they have the freedom to get out from under his control so that they can live their own lives. People need to be careful and watch out for someone like him, who only had his own interests in mind."" Peacock's ""Preaching Evil"" will premiere on April 26.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy Domain Money founder and CEO Adam Dell argues 'each individual needs to determine for themselves what level of risk is appropriate given their situation.' The heads of Berkshire Hathaway made clear in no uncertain terms that they still see no value in bitcoin and cryptocurrency. In a comparison between taking 1% ownership of all the land or apartment buildings in the United States at-value or 100% of the global supply of bitcoin for $25, CEO Warren Buffett said he would never take the bitcoin. BUFFETT COMPARES WALL STREET TO GAMBLERS, WOULD TRUST MONKEYS OVER FINANCIAL ADVISORS ""I have to sell it back to you one way or the other ... it isnt going to do anything,"" Buffett said. ""Thats the difference between productive assets and something that depends on someone paying you more than the last guy got,"" he added. Charlie Munger, vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., speaks to members of the media during a shareholders shopping day ahead of the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, U.S., on Friday, May 3, 2019. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway agreed earlier this week to make the investment in Occidental to help the oil producer with its $38 billion bid for Anadarko Petroleum Corp. Photographer: Houston Cofield/Bloomberg via Getty Images | Getty Images Buffetts argument rests on the idea that an asset must produce value as well as the idea that bitcoin ultimately must compete with the U.S. dollar and other currencies, which he believes will ultimately win out in any head-to-head. ""We can put up Berkshirecoins or put up Berkshire money ... but in the end, this is money, and theres no reason in the world why the United States currency, which people trust more ... this is the only thing thats money,"" he argued, adding that anyone who thinks the United States would move away from the dollar to a cryptocurrency is ""out of their minds."" BERKSHIRE VICE CHAIRMAN MUNGER: NO QUESTION THAT CHINA HAS WORRIED INVESTORS IN THE US Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger agreed with his partner's assessment, though used characteristically blunt terms to present his stance. ""In my life, I try to avoid things that are stupid, and evil, and make me look bad in comparison to someone else, and bitcoin does all three,"" Munger said. ""In the first place, its stupid because its very likely to go to zero, and its evil because it undermines the Federal Reserve System and national currency system, which we desperately need to maintain its integrity and government control and so on."" BUFFETT CALLS EVERY DAY A COIN FLIP WHEN IT COMES TO NUCLEAR WEAPONS ""And third, it makes us look foolish compared to the communist leader in China,"" Munger added. ""He was smart enough to ban bitcoin in China, and with all our presumed advantages of civilization, we are a lot dumber than the communist leader in China."" The pair had earlier praised the actions by the Fed to avoid long-lasting economic fallout in 2008 when the housing crisis started.

Restaurant workers are among the hardest working Americans who keep the country moving. The restaurant industry has faced serious struggles over the past several years, from violent protests in American cities in 2020 to excessive COVID-19 restrictions during the pandemic. More recently, rising inflation and the increase in remote workers has added stress and tension. WHY RESTAURANTS IN DEEP-BLUE CITIES ARE STRUGGLING MIGHTILY RIGHT NOW But when the going gets tough  the tough get going. That describes Kim Mahoney, the manager of the historic Warren Tavern in Charlestown, Mass. Mahoney, who lives in the greater Boston area, has worked at the Warren Tavern for 23 years. She has managed the tavern for almost 20 years. Kim Mahoney, manager of the Warren Tavern in the Charlestown neighborhood of Boston. ""Most places would turn them away,"" Mahoney said of the city kids hired by the tavern on a regular basis. (Photo by Suzanne Kreiter/The Boston Globe via Getty Images) ""I was born and raised in the one square mile of Charlestown,"" she told Fox News Digital. ""When I was growing up, no one had it easy. Everyone had different struggles."" Today, with that background and understanding, she goes out of her way to enrich the lives of others in similar circumstances  and gives them a leg up in the business she knows so well. Mahoney is proud of the Charlestown business community and of her workplace's unique history. ""The Warren Tavern is arguably the most historic Tavern in Massachusetts and possibly the United States,"" she said in the same interview with Fox News Digital. ""It was built in 1780 and named after General Joseph Warren, a forgotten patriot,"" she said. Gen. Joseph Warren was a 34-year-old physician and hero who died during the Revolutionary War at the Battle of Bunker Hill, according to the National Park Service. THIS LABOR DAY, A GRATEFUL NOD TO THE LONG-HAUL TRUCKERS THAT KEEP AMERICA MOVING Now, Mahoney passes on her own good fortune  and her strong work ethic  to a new generation of restaurant employees. ""I was taught and saw firsthand that if you think you have it bad, someone has it worse than you."" Mahoney started at the Warren Tavern as a server and bartender. In those early days, she often worked double shifts. The Warren Tavern in a photo taken in 1980. ""I often say to my staff, We are a family, and we take care of one another always, for better or worse,'"" said Mahoney. (Photo by Joe Dennehy/The Boston Globe via Getty Images) ""I would be on my feet for 15 hours, delivering food, getting drinks and cleaning tables."" She added, ""At the end of the day, you are mentally and physically drained."" Mahoney cut back on her hours after she got married and became a mom, she said. The job ""helped with our weekly income, so my husband, a Boston Police detective, could attend law school,"" she said. ANDRE RUSH, ARMY VETERAN AND CELEBRITY CHEF, BRINGS FRESH AWARENESS TO PTSD, SUICIDE PREVENTION Later, she added more hours back to her schedule, becoming the tavern's manager and handling the day-to-day operations of the restaurant. ""At the Warren Tavern,"" said Mahoney, ""we pride ourselves on being a family-first job. Our owners are extremely generous and family-oriented."" She added, ""I often say to my staff, We are a family, and we take care of one another always, for better or worse."" Mahoney managed the Warren Tavern through numerous COVID-19 challenges as well as other recent stressors in the industry. (iStock) Mahoney said that for the past 20 years the tavern has ""made a concentrated effort to hire local inner-city kids."" ""Most places would turn them away,"" she said. However, ""this is important to me because I was one of those young kids who had someone give me a chance when I had no experience,"" she said. ""Its something I will never forget."" ""They are also surrounded by the many other veteran staff members who serve as mentors to them. At one time those staff members were that new kid, too."" She continued, ""Most times, young people have no idea what direction they want to take in life. Growing up in the inner city can be extremely challenging."" Noting that most kids in the inner city are ""faced with so many adversities"" in their lives, whether it's ""at home or out in the neighborhood,"" Mahoney added that ""the things that they are exposed to, or have had happen to them, can be unimaginable."" Kim Mahoney (far left, first row) and her staff at the Warren Tavern. ""Ninety-eight percent of the kids who walk through the door have zero [job] experience,"" she said  but she gives them a chance. (Kim Mahoney) In the city, ""the temptation to fall into bad habits is very real,"" she said. It is why, she said, ""we pride ourselves on recruiting young people in the neighborhood who need a job and a sense of belonging. Ninety-eight percent of the kids who walk through the door have zero [job] experience."" She said that some of the kids who walk through the tavern's door ""are shy, some are edgy and some have no confidence."" ""It might not be the most glamorous job, but those in the industry take great pride in their work."" With some, she said, ""you just cant put a finger on"" their personal challenges. ""Our training is simple. We pair them with another server who comes from a similar background. They are also surrounded by the many veteran staff members who serve as mentors to them."" She also said, ""At one time those staff members were that new kid, too."" Kim Mahoney (far right) along with her husband Paul and their two children, Patrick and Maeve. Paul Mahoney served as a Boston police detective while earning a law degree; Kim Mahoney continued to work at Warren Tavern. (Kim Mahoney) While training can be challenging, Mahoney said that ""you eventually begin to see that inner beauty coming out and the confidence build, because that kid knows they now have a skill that will take them through life. And most importantly, they are now part of a special family."" Once that new ""family member"" is ""up and running,"" said Mahoney, ""we spend time offering guidance about what the next steps in life will look like. It could be going to college or a trade school. We always encourage ambition."" MARTHA'S VINEYARD CHURCH ANSWERED CALL TO AID MIGRANTS: WE CAN TAKE IN ALL OF THEM Mahoney said, ""My staff makes me so proud, and I love them so much. We dont have a lot of turnover. Most have been with me since they started at the age of 16."" Others who have worked at the tavern have gone on to college and now have other careers. Some have gotten married and have children of their own. Kim Mahoney told Fox News Digital about the tavern, ""We dont have a lot of turnover."" Most of the workers, she said, ""have been with me since they started at the age of 16."" (iStock/Kim Mahoney) ""They are all remarkable in their own ways,"" she said.
